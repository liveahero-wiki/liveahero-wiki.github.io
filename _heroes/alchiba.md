## Notes

"I’m Alchiba, just a plain old private detective, no biggie. Glad to meet such a wonderful client as yourself. Now then, let’s settle things up. What’s your request?"

A winged alien who runs a detective bureau.

Because of his good-looking facial features and captivating narrow eyes, he's a self-proclaimed "nihilistic and cool" handsome detective. In reality, he's a flirty playboy who tries to seduce even his own clients, showing just how lecherous and greedy he is.

He tends to speak incessant bickering that could set anyone's teeth on edge. Nevertheless, he firmly follows his creed that "He will fulfill any requests recieved even if he dies in the process". This is because of his established reputation for laboral perfection, which has the detective industry thriving beyond expectation.
