## Notes:

"HIT☆ME with that gaze of yours! Hitomi Ayauta here! Pretty AND strong, that's Hitomi's motto! Let's do our best, Mr. Partner!"

A half-Earthling and half-alien girl, located in Japan, Earth, to perform idol activities. Born in Hiroshima, Japan. Her stage name is Ayauta Hitomi. A traditional school idol who is lively, friendly, and always does her best.

However, due to the genetic inheritance of her mother, an alien, she has acquired over-engineered physical capabilities for an Earthling. She often loses control of her abilities, so she's very prone to destroying equipment unintentionally. Because of this, she is especially afraid of situations in which she has to touch another person's body, such as handshake events.
