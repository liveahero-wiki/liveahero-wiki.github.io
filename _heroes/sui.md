## Notes

"I'm Sui, a designer apprentice. If I can save people with my needlework, then... please, make use of it as you see fit."

An apprentice clothing designer from Orient City studying design under tutorship.

As someone born in the Lunar Capital, they are half-Lunarian and half-Earthling.

Since they were acquainted with clothes from an early age, they have a deep knowledge of clothing and fashion.

They posses a cool and dry personality and a somewhat poisonous tongue. Dialogue with customers is important while in the position of a designer, but they're not good at interacting with others.

They have been afflicted by the gap between their body and mind ever since childhood.
