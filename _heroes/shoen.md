A calligrapher who owns a small calligraphy one-room school in Orient City. He is also an educator registered as visiting scholar at university's literature department.

He is an alien from a different world who has devoted his life pursuing calligraphy ever since he became strongly impressed with the culture of japan, the country of earth he first landed on.

He has a habit of giving folded origami figures to the children he meets.
