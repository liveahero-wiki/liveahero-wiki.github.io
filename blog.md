## 2021-10-31: Survey Result

Thank you for those who have participated! Sorry for the delay, I actually started curating the result since 7 Oct, but procrastinated to finish it...

Before we start, be reminded that the data is by no means representative to the entire LAH playerbase, as mostly only English players who use this wiki have contributed to the survey.

### Demographic

</figure>

91.8% of the respondents identify as male, 1.3% as female and the rest as "other". I expected the number of female
players to be low, but not *this* low... 10.6% of the respondents identify as non-binary.

Some people also misunderstood "gender" with sexuality as they put "bisexual" in "gender. Just a reminder that those two attributes mean very different things.

</figure>

In terms of age, we can see that majority of the respondents are in their 20s. Not a single person above 40 years old, though I do know there is at least one Japanese player that is above 50. 7.4% of the people are below 18, even though this game has been constantly testing the limit of R18...

</figure>


More than 70% of the respondents have some degree of Japanese understanding, with 13.4% of them having studied Japanese at various N* level. 2 respondents are even native speakers! (Hello Japanese people :wave:)

~~Hope you all like my choice of "important Japanese words".~~

In terms of country, the top 3 are United States (33.9%), Indonesia (6.1%) and Vietname (5.3%)

### The Game

</figure>

2.4% of the respondents don't even play the game, I guess they are just here for the character arts. Close to 90% of the people have played "Tokyo Afterschool Summoners", another (older) gacha game developed by LifeWonders.

In retrospect, I should have added a question asking if those who aren't playing LAH right now are waiting for official English translation.

Let just say we know LifeWonders all too well... but I am sure those 69.8% of the people were more than happy to be proven wrong.

</figure>

Caveat:

- Characters with zero vote are not included in the plot
- Characters added after 1st anniversary (such as {% chara_link Okitaka %}) are not included

In general, it seems that furries are way more popular than human according to the respondents.

Unsurprisingly, character appearance is the biggest factor why a person stan the character.

I asked "If you can ask for only one improvement to the game, what would it be", and received a huge variety of comments. Listing them down one by one won't be possible in this page, so I generate a word cloud instead.

</figure>

Highlights:

- Out of 160 "most wanted" improvements, 36 asked for English translation, 24 mentioned about pity/sparking system.

### The Wiki

</figure>

I know that some wiki features aren't very visible, and I do plan to increase their visibility in more places.

I also recently learnt that many people (mostly on Reddit) have been playing this game without understanding
the story at all, so I want to take this opportunity to advertise [Fan Translation Summaries](https://housamosummaries.blogspot.com/) by Roureem (link also found in wiki homepage). If you prefer videos, there is also a [Youtube channel by Ayato K](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz6Yn6nD_TkVKHbnER9VdWA).

Well, that's all for the survey result. Hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. I will probably make this survey an annual tradition.

## 2021-09-23: Wiki's 1st anniversary!

> If you are looking for news about 1st anniversary celebration for the actual game, this is not it

Exactly one year ago, I laid out the ground work for this fan wiki (see [commit](https://github.com/liveahero-wiki/liveahero-wiki.github.io/commit/7afbf575428a8b9af2603c251c88f04e2b3c9ace)).
I wanted a wiki that is built on top of automation so that we can get accurate skill descriptions ASAP, and I didn't want to have ads
like those fandom wikis. There are some technical decisions that I regret now, such as hosting it on Github Pages instead of Netlify (the former
lacks proper support of page redirection, more sensible caching, or unlimited website size), but at least the whole thing doesn't cost me a single cent.

Making this wiki like an open source project on Github has made it harder to get wiki contributors as the usual contribution
workflow is very different. Despite that, we have enough volunteers to help translate skill names, voice lines, sales reports and special quests as well as
writing gameplay guides. Huge thank you to all their work so that we the japanese-illiterate people can play this game.

I had wanted to make an art to celebrate this, but the thought of having to draw everyone from [Parallel Flight](/affiliations/#parallel-flight) to be "fair" is 
too daunting that I never started. (You can still find my other arts at [@rongjie_mini](https://twitter.com/rongjie_mini) (NSFW warning)).

But still we can have some fun here. I created a survey to collect some interesting statistics from the community. The survey
will close after awhile, then I will find some time to comb through the data and publish the result here.
