## Event Preview

Orient City’s Summer Tradition: Hero City Summer Festa.
Even though the hot summer festival has come to an end, the heroes' festival is far from over!

A brand-new event is set to take place on the lunar city, Archimedes Colony.
It’s a grand festival that gathers celebrations from all across the galaxy into one massive extravaganza.
Called - Galaxy Carnival Expo!

While you're hard at work running a food stall at the Summer Festa, a request comes your way—from none other than the heroes themselves.
One is a self-proclaimed Number One Festival Guy of Orient City: the gunman cop.
The other is a languid magician who knows absolutely nothing about Japanese festivals.

You accept their request and head to the Moon to help out with the event.
There, you also team up with a cheerful young tour conductor.
Together with the heroes, you begin a streaming campaign to promote Japanese festivals!

From the Festival of the Fashion City to the Festival of the Flower City,
and even original festivals born from the idea, “Wouldn’t it be fun to have a festival like this?”
The Moon becomes a sizzling hot festival hotspot!
Can the heroes successfully showcase the charm of Japanese festivals to the entire galaxy?

Under the Earth and fireworks lighting up the lunar sky,
a festival that connects people, stars, and memories—
is about to begin.
