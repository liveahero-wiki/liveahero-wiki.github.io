## Event Preview

This is a story of a certain summer day.

Every summer, the seaside town Orient City holds a citywide festival of heroes, "Hero City Summer Festa".

The highlight of the event was the "O-1 Hero Grand Prix",
a battle competition between hero offices,
Parallel Flight, which failed to meet the requirements for participation, 
opened a beach cafe in the restaurant area and 
worked tirelessly to serve customers and prepare food.

...But then suddenly, 
the friendly commander-in-chief of the Japanese branch of the UEHA appeared.
He request your help as a hero operator for the duration of the tournament because he's short on staff...!?

A gunfighter cop who wants to shine in a way that's appropriate for the summer,
 a rescue captain who wants to get rid of his fearsome image, 
and other familiar UEHA members join forces and get ready for a battle tournament!
Can UEHA become the city's brightest hero office this summer!?
