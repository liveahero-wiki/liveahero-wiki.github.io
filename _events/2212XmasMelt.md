## Event Preview

A Christmas music festival is held on a certain planet.
Procy was offered a job as a security guard for the festival.

Together with Gomeisa who had shown great interest in this star-studded Christmas celebration, you and Crowne is also assigned to guard the event.

The town you visit is all decked out and ready for the event, and it's all about Christmas!
Snow was forecast for the day of the event, and you were looking forward to a white Christmas.......

The next day, the sun shining through the window was scorching hot!
And even kaibutsu appears, wreaking havoc on the town's inhabitants!

In an attempt to solve the mystery of the abnormal weather, the group heads for the Crystal Tower, which is said to control the weather.
However, a singer-songwriter girl and a giant scientist, a suspiciously uneven duo, appear to be plotting something there...

In the melting heat, will the heroes be able to bring back the snowy Holy Night?
