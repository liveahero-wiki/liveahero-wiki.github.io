## Event Preview

In the city of Cogsden, a metropolis that flourished through a fusion of ether and steam technology,
the quiet spread of Kaibutsu damage has prompted a call for help to various hero agencies.

Answering that call are:
a Story book author hero who lives in the city,
a construction-site rigger hero from the Labor' Site,
and you, who arrive on-site alongside your Observer senior disciple,
to conduct research under special environmental conditions.

As the four of you carry out your investigation,
a certain popular counselor among the townsfolk becomes the topic of discussion.

“Anger, sorrow, loneliness—let us bid farewell to all the painful memories of the past.”

The counselor who can make clients forget their very troubles is known as Vulpecula.
But is this person truly the notorious master thief pursued by the Galactic Police Federation,
or merely an impostor borrowing that infamous name?

Overhead, the city’s great clock tower, Cogsden’s proud symbol,
looks down upon the group as they chase the mystery.

Will the case be solved as ideally as hoped—
and will they glimpse a future filled with light and promise?
