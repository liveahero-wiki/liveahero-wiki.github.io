## About Rank 1 Characters

The characters that can be obtained in this campaign comes as rank 1 hero units and rank 1 sidekick units.

Rank 1 units can participate in battle and sale just like normal characters but there are several differences when it comes to upgrading them.

Hero units with initial rank of 1 can be promoted up to rank 6. Aside from regular rank up materials their promotions will also require a new item {% include item.html id=53 %} "Proof of Hero".

Additionally their 3rd skill will at first be locked and unusable in battle until they are promoted to rank 3, and one specific skill will be upgraded when they are promoted to rank 5 (there is no rank 5 art for units with initial rank of 1).

### Hero's Fan Count

Hero units with initial rank of 1 can only gain fan count from their own personal Hero's Memories items. Said items will also can't be exchanged for {% include item.html id=40 %}.

Their fan count will only increase by 1 with each item used.

### Sidekick's Limit Breakthrough
