## Event Preview

Shinraku, a town in Kyoto created by aliens.
Before a festival held there every spring, a disturbing rumor begins to spread.

It is said that if one gets too close to the ghostly palanquin, they will be spirited away.

Is it just a rumor?
Or perhaps an incident caused by someone else?

To find out the truth,
A competent detective from UEHA visits Shinraku to find out about it.

With the cooperation of a first-rate child actor,
he attempted to make contact with a suspicious man who calls himself a local actor.

He guides you through the streets of Shinraku,
and together with the heroes, you will unravel the history that lies dormant in this land....
