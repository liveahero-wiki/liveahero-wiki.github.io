## About Quest

You can read scenarios, and battle to obtain items.

## Quest Selection

On the quest selection menu, by either hold tapping on the quest banner, or by tapping on the magnifying glass icon, will display the information of enemies encountered, along with the items that can possibly be obtained.

## Main Quest

This is the quest where you can read the game's main story.

## Enhancement/ Training Quest

These quests are meant for gathering items that can be used to raise and rank up [Heroes](/guide/hero) and [Sidekicks](/guide/sidekick). Enhancement Quests are divided by rank, with higher ranks offering better rewards at the cost of being more difficult and consuming higher levels of stamina.

### EXP Item Quests

EXP Item Quests can be selected at any time, and come in four ranks (D to A). These quests award each Hero and Sidekick with large, fixed amount of EXP, so it is recommended to bring along as many Heroes and Sidekicks as possible. There is a spillover effect for max level Heroes and Sidekicks. As such, the EXP a max level Hero would have received is converted into {% include item.html id=11 %}, whereas Sidekick EXP is converted into {% include item.html id=30 %}. In addition, EXP Item Quests drop {% include item.html id=11 %}, {% include item.html id=30 %}, and {% include item.html id=35 %}.

| Rank | Enemy Level | Stamina Cost | EXP / Hero | EXP / Sidekick | EXP Drops  (average) | Coin | Training Bands | Rank EXP |
|:----:|:-----------:|:------------:|:----------:|:--------------:|:--------------------:|:----:|:--------------:|:--------:|
|   D  |      1      |       6      |     135    |       60       |          250         |  120 |        0       |    60    |
|   C  |      15     |      10      |     280    |       125      |          350         |  250 |       50       |    100   |
|   B  |      30     |      14      |     472    |       210      |          370         |  420 |       100      |    140   |
|   A  |      45     |      18      |     810    |       360      |          910         |  720 |       150      |    180   |

<!--- Quest rewards appear to have some variation, but my sample size was low (N=5 for each quest). This might require a weighted average but until I have more data points I'll do a simple average of the drop types I've seen. It seems there are three drop tiers per rank so far. --->
<!--- However, I found no variation in EXP per Hero/Sidekick, Rank EXP, as well as Coin and Training Band drops so far.  --->
<!--- Take the current values with a grain of salt as I gather more data points (also pls donate stamina drinks, thanks). --->
