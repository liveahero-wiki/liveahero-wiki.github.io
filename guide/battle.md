### Battle Flow

The battle timeline shows each character's order of actions. Order of action is determined by a Hero's speed (SPD). The higher their SPD stat, the sooner their chance to strike. Skills can only be selected and activated during a Hero's turn. After all characters have performed their actions, the turn is over. If desired, a Hero's turn order can be delayed to the end of turn by choosing to wait (purple icon with the hourglass).

### Battle Auto Mode

By tapping on the Auto button located at the top right of the battle screen, auto battle mode will commence.
As of now auto battle will only enable each hero to use their basic 0 view cost skills at random target.

### View Power

At the bottom of the battle screen is a number that represents the Battle's current View Power. This power granted by viewers is required to activate certain skills. Whenever the character execute an action, the character's View Power increases. Your own heroes and enemy share the same View Power for skills usage. Some skills have an effect on gaining View Powers, e.g. {% chara_link Polaris Mask %} Mic Performance.

### Combo

Combo counter increase by one for every consecutive actions done by your heroes. Starting from combo 2 any view generated by active hero will be increased by 10% for each combo (maximum view increase from combo is 50%)  i.e.: 1.1x view at combo 2, 1.2x view at combo 3, etc. Combo will be reset to 0 when any enemy unit take action in battle.
>Certain heroes have skills that increase combo count {% chara_link Barrel %} /{% chara_link Kyoichi %} or skills that make use of combo count as damage multiplier {% chara_link Barrel %}/{% chara_link Toshu %})

### Battle Menu Button

By tapping on the Menu button located at the bottom right of the battle screen, the player can choose to give up on the current battle.

### Battle List Button

By tapping on the List button located at the bottom right of the battle screen, the player can view the skills of their heroes by their order of actions. This includes the skill descriptions as well as their View Power cost.

### Status Modifiers

During the battle, the character can be affected by several statuses. The number of actions left in a status could decrease under various conditions, such as number of actions, or they may last until the end of the turn. In the case of defensive buffs, actions are called attacks. When action counter reaches 0, the status is removed.

Statuses that grant positive effects on the hero are displayed as a yellow icon, also known as "Buffs". Conversely, statuses that afflict the hero with negative effects are displayed as a red icon, also known as "Debuffs".

The available status modifiers are listed as follows:

## Drop item

In quests, items may be available as a random drop. For instance, many quests will award additional EXP in the form of {% include item.html id=11 %}, as well as {% include item.html id=35 %}. Additionally, a special clear bonus is given during the first clear of most quests.

## Support

After quest selection, another player's Hero and respective Sidekick can be selected as Support for that battle. Depending on the quest, an NPC support might be locked in place of a player's support. When a Hero is selected as Support, both their operating player and the player receiving support will earn {% include item.html id=42 %} (Friend Points): 100 if they are friends, or 50 if they are not.

If a non-friend Support is chosen, it is possible to request that player to become a friend after the battle has ended. Supports can be set for other users to use under the Support tag via the Options menu > Player Settings. <!-- needs a screenshot -->
