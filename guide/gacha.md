## About Gacha

You can use Ether Stones to obtain heroes or sidekicks, and Friend Points to obtain various items.
You can check for the details on the obtainable units for the gacha by tapping on the "Offer Ratio" button.

## Hero's Memories and Sidekick's Mind

Whenever you acquire a duplicate hero/ sidekick, it will be automatically converted into a Hero's Memories/ Sidekick's Mind respectively.
The Hero's Memories can be used to increase the "Hero's Fan Count", while the Sidekick's Mind can be used to increase the "Sidekick's Limit Breakthrough".
