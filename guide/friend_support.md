## Friend Code/Friend

Many existing players have a suite of max leveled units and sidekicks to be borrowed by other players. Having strong friend support can carry your party all on their own for most of the quests, and the best part of this is that friend supports characters cost nothing to borrow. In fact, it gives {% include item.html id=42 %} to you and your friend.

- Each time when you use another player's support that is not your friend yet, both you and the other player gain +50 {% include item.html id=42 %}
- Each time when you use your friend's support, both you and your friend gain +100 {% include item.html id=42 %}

{% include item.html id=42 %} can be used in [Friend Point Gacha](/guide/gacha/#friend-point-gacha)

To gain friends quickly, you will want to share your friend code, which is a 9-digit code (found in the Friends section of the game), in various places. A good place for now is LAH community discord.

### Player ID

From the main menu, select "Friends" and then "Search for Friends".

On the lower part of the screen you will find your Player ID. Noting this number down is recommended, as it is something Lifewonders will ask you if you have to contact their support to recover your account.

### Setup Your Support List

You can set your own list of support units from the support setting button in team menu.

You can add up to 6 pairs of Heroes and Sidekicks (+ some Sidekick Passives) in the list, one for each Hero Attribute and one Free Support with restriction on the Hero Attribute.
