## Summon Currency

How do I obtain more characters?

Apart from characters you'll receive after completing certain chapters in the story, you will want to spend 50 Ether stones on multi-pulls for Premium Gachas. 

Characters in Live A Hero are divided into two categories, namely Heroes and Sidekick, Heroes are the character you use in battle while sidekicks are their partner that act like an equipment i.e.: providing stats boost and skills to the hero.

You can get both heroes and sidekicks from the Premium Gacha

Premium Gachas are mainly based on the current event, which as of now only one is available (Akatsuki's Golden Spirit).

### Ether Stones (Premium Event Gacha/Premium Standard Gacha)

5 {% include item.html id=2 %} for Single Pull, 50 {% include item.html id=2 %} for Multi-Pull

Bare to mind to do multi-pulls if you want to obtain a guaranteed ☆4 or ☆5 on the 10th pull. 

It's also recommended to pull mainly from the Event Gachas since they usually include drops from the Premium Standard Gacha anyway.

Here are some ways to earn more free stones:

- Earn 1 {% include item.html id=2 %} for every quest you complete for the first time. Look for new events for fresh quests to complete. 
- Earn 50 {% include item.html id=2 %} for first day of play 
- Earn 6 {% include item.html id=2 %} for daily logins on a weekly cycle (2 on Day 4, 4 on Day 8)
- Earn 1 {% include item.html id=2 %} daily for completing the daily missions
- Earn extra stones for cumulative logins , Main quest missions and standard missions, check [missions](/guide/mission/) for detail
- Purchase stones with real-life money. (Be responsible!)
- Gain stones from LifeWonders after server maintenance, issues, or login campaigns.

### Friend Points (Friend Points Gacha)

1000 points for 10-Pull only

Give a variety of items such as: {% include item.html id=11 %}, {% include item.html id=35 %}, {% include item.html id=31 %}

The grand prize in Friend Gacha is a player sidekick dupe {% include item-icon.html id=219991 %}.

- Gain +50 {% include item.html id=42 %} every time you use other player's support
- Gain +50 {% include item.html id=42 %} every time other player use your support
- Gain +100 {% include item.html id=42 %} every time you use your friend's support
- Gain +100 {% include item.html id=42 %} every time your friend use your support

### Ether Tickets

{% include item.html id=10 %} are rare tickets that allow for a single pull (can't do multi-pulls sadly with these tickets) on any Premium Gacha.

- Gain 1 {% include item.html id=10 %} from event shops (usually 10 from a new event).
- Gain 1 {% include item.html id=10 %} as a possible reward by completing a high difficulty mission.


## Friend Code/Friend

Despite the game being relatively new there are a lot of players who has max leveled unit (level 50) and if you're lucky enough to be accepted as friend by them, 
you will now have a Support that can carry your party all on their own at least until the middle difficulty quest, and the best part of this is that friend supports characters cost nothing to borrow in fact it gives friend point to you and your friend.

To gain friends quickly, you will want to share your friend code, which is a 9-digit code (found in the Friends section of the game), in various places. A good place for now is LAH community discord.


## About Characters Rarity

The game contains up to 4 ratings for each hero, from a 3 star rating to 6 star rating, any hero can be upgraded to 6 star rating eventually and as of now no hero starts at 6 star rating.

Each hero has two different portrait, with the first unlocked from the beginning and the second unlocked at 5 star rarity (for natural 5 star heroes the two portraits are unlocked from the beginning)

Sidekicks has different system than heroes, with a 3 star rating to 4 star rating, and no possible way to upgrade rarity.


## About Team

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="/assets/img/systempage_2.png" alt="Team" height=500px>
{: refdef}

A team is made of up of 4 of your own heroes ,4 of your sidekicks and, when you enter battle, 1 Support (a hero and sidekick from another player), for a total of 5 Heroes and 5 sidekicks. 

4 heroes can fight at one time, with one of your heroes being sub-heroes. When one of your hero is defeated, it will be swapped out for a sub-hero in its place at the next turn.


## Keeping Your Account Safe

It is recommended to follow these steps to make it easier to recover your account in case you lose access to it.

### Backing up your user key

userKey is the file that keeps your account data. If you lose access to the device where you play the game you can simply install the game on another device and copy the userKey to the game folder. 

This means that making a copy of your userKey and keeping it somewhere safe is highly recommended. 

you can find userKey on Android devices under `/SD/Android/data/jp.co.lifewonders.liveahero/files/Data/`.

### Player ID

From the main menu, select "Friends" and then "Search for Friends".

On the lower part of the screen you will find your Player ID. Noting this number down is recommended, as it is something Lifewonders will ask you if you have to contact their support to recover your account.

## Tips

If your team happens to die during a quest, do NOT use a stone to revive your party unless you're absolutely desperate. 
You can just leave the battle and the stamina will be refunded.
