## Keeping Your Account Safe

It is recommended to follow these steps to make it easier to recover your account in case you lose access to it.

### Backing up your user key (Android user only)

`userKey` is the file that keeps your account data. If you lose access to the device where you play the game you can simply install the game on another device and copy the userKey to the game folder. 

This means that making a copy of your userKey and keeping it somewhere safe is highly recommended. 

You can find userKey on Android devices under `/SD/Android/data/jp.co.lifewonders.liveahero/files/Data/`.

For Android 11+, you may need to **connect your phone to a computer** and access app data folder from your computer.

## How to Back-up Your Data

To create a transfer code data, simply start up the game, go past the title screen, and go to Options(オプション) on main menu. 

Then hit Transfer Account (アカウント引継ぎ) at the second option from the top,
Enter a password into both boxes of your choosing and hit the blue bottom right-most button. 

Write down the Code it gives you AND the password you used.

When you're ready or need to use it, start up the game. At the Title Screen, hit the bottom left button (Account Transfer/アカウント引継ぎ). 

Enter the Code in the top box, and your custom password you made in the bottom box. Then hit the blue button.

>NOTE: When you transfer your account to another device using this code, a new `userKey` file will be created in this device and your account will be bound to this new `userKey`, while the previous `userKey` will be become invalid. So remember to backup this new `userKey` after transferring your data, as **the previous `userKey` will be rendered useless**.

## Tips

If your team happens to die during a quest, do NOT use a stone to revive your party unless you're absolutely desperate. 
You can just leave the battle and the stamina will be refunded.
