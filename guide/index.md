## Summon Currency

How do I obtain more characters?

Apart from characters you'll receive after completing certain chapters in the story, you will want to spend 50 {% include item.html id=2 %} on multi-pulls for Limited-time Gacha and Permanent Gacha. 

Characters in Live A Hero are divided into two categories, namely Heroes and Sidekick. Heroes are the character you use in battle while sidekicks are their partner that act like an equipment i.e.: providing stats boost and skills to the hero.

You can get both heroes and sidekicks from the Limited-time Gacha and Permanent Gacha

### Ether Stones (Limited-time Gacha and Permanent Gacha)

5 {% include item.html id=2 %} for Single Pull, 50 {% include item.html id=2 %} for Multi-Pull

Multi-pulls has a guaranteed ☆4 or ☆5 on the 10th pull, so it is often recommended to save enough {% include item.html id=2 %} until you can do a multi-pull.

It's also recommended to pull mainly from the Event Gachas since they usually include drops from the Premium Standard Gacha anyway.

Here are some ways to earn more free stones:

- Earn 1 {% include item.html id=2 %} for every quest you complete for the first time. Look for new events for fresh quests to complete. 
- Earn 50 {% include item.html id=2 %} for first day of play 
- Earn 6 {% include item.html id=2 %} for daily logins on a weekly cycle (2 on Day 4, 4 on Day 8)
- Earn 1 {% include item.html id=2 %} daily for completing the daily missions
- Earn extra stones for cumulative logins , Main quest missions and standard missions, check [missions](/guide/mission/) for detail
- Purchase stones with real-life money. (Be responsible!)
- Gain stones from LifeWonders after server maintenance, issues, or login campaigns.

### Ether Tickets

{% include item.html id=10 %} are rare tickets that allow for a single pull (can't do multi-pulls sadly with these tickets) on any Premium Gacha.

- Gain 1 {% include item.html id=10 %} from event shops (usually 10 from a new event).
- Gain 1 {% include item.html id=10 %} as a possible reward by completing a high difficulty mission.


## Friend Code/Friend

Many existing players have a suite of max leveled units and sidekicks to be borrowed by other players. Having strong friend support can carry your party all on their own for most of the quests, and the best part of this is that friend supports characters cost nothing to borrow. In fact, it gives {% include item.html id=42 %} to you and your friend.

- Each time when you use another player's support that is not your friend yet, both you and the other player gain +50 {% include item.html id=42 %}
- Each time when you use your friend's support, both you and your friend gain +100 {% include item.html id=42 %}

To gain friends quickly, you will want to share your friend code, which is a 9-digit code (found in the Friends section of the game), in various places. A good place for now is LAH community discord.

## About Characters Rarity

There are two types of hero:

- **Regular Heroes** have initial star rating from 3 star to 5 star
  - They can be obtained from Permanent Gacha banner, Limited-time Gacha banner, and certain Missions or Shops
  - Each regular hero has two different portraits. Hero with initial rating of 5 star will have 2 portraits unlocked immediately. Other hero need to be first upgraded to 5 star to unlocked the second portrait
- **Mob Heroes** have initial star rating at 1 star
  - They usually can only be obtained by exchanging in Event limited shop
  - Each mob hero only has one portrait, and has no voice actings

Any heroes can be upgraded to 6 star.

Sidekicks has different system than heroes, with a 3 star rating to 4 star rating, and no possible way to upgrade rarity.


## About Team

A team is made of up of 5 Heroes and 5 sidekicks.

In most battles, you only need to have 4 pairs of your own heroes and sidekicks, then just borrow a friend support for one extra pair of hero and sidekick.

Each hero can also equip some sidekick passives. Hero with <= 5 star rank can equip up to 2 sidekick passives. Hero with 6 star rank can equip up to 3 sidekick passives.

4 heroes can fight at one time, with one of your heroes being sub-heroes. When one of the hero in your team is defeated, it will be swapped out for a sub-hero in its place at the next turn.

### Support Unit

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
<img src="/assets/img/Support.png" alt="Team" height=500px loading="lazy">
{: refdef}

You can set your own support unit from the support setting button in team menu, select the hero and the corresponding sidekick to set as your support so that your friends can use your unit in battle (thus netting you friend points)

## Keeping Your Account Safe

It is recommended to follow these steps to make it easier to recover your account in case you lose access to it.

### Backing up your user key (Android user only)

`userKey` is the file that keeps your account data. If you lose access to the device where you play the game you can simply install the game on another device and copy the userKey to the game folder. 

This means that making a copy of your userKey and keeping it somewhere safe is highly recommended. 

You can find userKey on Android devices under `/SD/Android/data/jp.co.lifewonders.liveahero/files/Data/`.

For Android 11+, you may need to **connect your phone to a computer** and access app data folder from your computer.

### Player ID

From the main menu, select "Friends" and then "Search for Friends".

On the lower part of the screen you will find your Player ID. Noting this number down is recommended, as it is something Lifewonders will ask you if you have to contact their support to recover your account.

## How to Back-up Your Data

To create a transfer code data, simply start up the game, go past the title screen, and go to Options(オプション) on main menu. 

Then hit Transfer Account (アカウント引継ぎ) at the second option from the top,
Enter a password into both boxes of your choosing and hit the blue bottom right-most button. 

Write down the Code it gives you AND the password you used.

When you're ready or need to use it, start up the game. At the Title Screen, hit the bottom left button (Account Transfer/アカウント引継ぎ). 

Enter the Code in the top box, and your custom password you made in the bottom box. Then hit the blue button.

>NOTE: When you transfer your account to another device using this code, a new `userKey` file will be created in this device and your account will be bound to this new `userKey`, while the previous `userKey` will be become invalid. So remember to backup this new `userKey` after transferring your data, as **the previous `userKey` will be rendered useless**.

## Tips

If your team happens to die during a quest, do NOT use a stone to revive your party unless you're absolutely desperate. 
You can just leave the battle and the stamina will be refunded.
