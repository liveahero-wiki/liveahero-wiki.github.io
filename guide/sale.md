## Business Shortening and Canceling

Business can be shortened and canceled.

If you wanted to shorten the duration of a sale, a Business Shortening Ticket is required to do so.

A Business Shortening Ticket could shorten the timing by 10 minutes for a bronze tier ticket, 30 minutes for a silver tier ticket, and 1 hour for a gold tier ticket.

As a result from shortening, if the business hour is lesser than the shortening hour, business will be completed, and reward will also be distributed accordingly.

Stopping an ongoing business will not return anything.
