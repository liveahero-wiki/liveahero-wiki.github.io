{: refdef}

You can leave the hero for a set amount of time during the business. Sales reward currency needed to improve your characters: {% include item.html id=11 %}, {% include item.html id=35 %} (Laf), and {% include item.html id=30 %} (Training Bands). All sale types reward some EXP.

## Business Slot

There are four business slots. Initially, only two are unlocked. An additional slot is unlocked after beating Chapter 1 of the [Main Quest](/guide/quest/#main-quest), while the fourth slot is unlockable with a Business Slot Unlock Ticket purchasable from the [Shop](/guide/shop/) for 10 {% include item.html id=1 %}.

Heroes departed onto an ongoing business cannot be assigned onto a different business. However, they are free to participate in [Quests](/guide/quest/).

## Business Hour

Business can be conducted in set amounts of time: two hours, four hours, eight hours, and 16 hours. There is no difference in efficiency as the rewards scale linearly with the amount of time spent, so choose a timing that fits your lifestyle. Note that rewards are cumulative with business obtainable experience values.

|  Time  |  EXP |  Laf | Training Band |
|:------:|:----:|:----:|:-------------:|
|  2:00h |  400 {% include item-icon.html id=11 %} |  960 {% include item-icon.html id=35 %} |      640 {% include item-icon.html id=30 %}      |

## Business Obtainable Experience

Experience points will be given to all heroes who have departed on the business. In case the hero's level is already at its limit, the experience will be given in the form of item instead. The EXP rewards per type of sale for each amount of time can be found in the table below.

| Time   | EXP  | Laf | Training Band |
|:--------:|:------:|:------:|:----------:|
| 2:00h  | 400 {% include item-icon.html id=11 %}  | 160 {% include item-icon.html id=11 %}  | 160 {% include item-icon.html id=11 %}      |

## Business Bonus

The amount of currency obtained in each type of Sale is increased by a bonus. Heroes going on the business give a +5% bonus, up to maximum of +45% if all eight slots are filled; 5★ Heroes provide an additional +5%, up to a maximum of 45%. Hence, the maximum total of bonus for each sale is +90% for a team of eight 5★ Heroes. Obtainable experience is also affected by this bonus.

## Business Log

When a business has been completed you will receive a business log from the characters who have departed for the business.

## Business Shortening and Canceling

Business can be shortened and canceled.

Business Shortening Tickets can be used to shorten the duration of a sale. Business Shortening Ticket come in several tiers of efficacy: bronze, silver, and gold. As a result from shortening, if the business hour is less than the shortening amount, the business will be instantly completed.

| Tier   | Shortening amount (mins) |
|:--------:|:------------------------:|
| Bronze {% include item-icon.html id=31 %} | 10                     |
| Silver {% include item-icon.html id=32 %} | 30                     |
| Gold   {% include item-icon.html id=33 %} | 60                     |


Stopping an ongoing business will instantly complete the business, but with no rewards.
