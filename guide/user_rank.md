## About Stamina

Players have stamina.

Some quests consumes stamina upon accepting the challenge.

You can recover stamina either by waiting over the time, consuming Stamina Drinks, or recharge using Ether Stone.

The current stamina can be checked at the top of the game screen.

## Stamina Recovery Time

Stamina recovers once every 8 minutes.
Losing a battle will not consume any stamina by default, with the exception to some battles.

## User Rank

User Rank shows the user's skill level.

Clearing a battle will award user experience points, and accumulating user experience points will increase the user rank.

As the user rank increases, the max stamina limit will also increase, along with a stamina recovery.

User Rank is currently maxed out at level 160. The current user rank can be checked at the top of the game screen.
