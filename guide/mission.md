## Mission

**Mission** is a list of objectives that the player can clear in order to collect their respective rewards upon completion. There are currently 3 types of missions: *Daily Mission*, *Limited-time Mission*, and *Standard Mission*.

### Daily Mission

Daily missions are short and quick tasks that can be completed just by playing the game normally.

Daily missions will only reset after the daily rotation, which is scheduled to happen after 0000 hours (GMT+9) daily.

### Limited-time Mission

Limited-time missions are special missions that is only avaiable during a specific period of time. They are usually tied behind an ongoing event, in which the mission will no longer be available to clear after the time duration has ended.

### Standard Mission

Standard missions are permanent missions that can be cleared at any point of time. They can only be cleared once and their progress will not reset.
