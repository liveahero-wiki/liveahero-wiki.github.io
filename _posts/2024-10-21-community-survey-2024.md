# Foreword

We have achieved 606 responses in this year’s survey, more than twice the amount from last year’s iteration!

Thank you to those who have helped me spread the word on various social media platforms! Also thank you to those who helped to catch typos and mistranslations in the survey as this is the first time I added Mandarin/Japanese translations in the survey.

This report was incredibly hard to write due to the complexity to test the legitimacy of some responses and sheer volume of data. I also spent a lot of time trying to find data relationships that are worth telling, and coding up the visualizations for them.

# Respondent Profile

## Source of respondents

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/source.svg"
  title="Source of Respondents" %}

Majority of the respondents found the survey via Discord, 巴哈姆特 (a Taiwan game forum) and X (Twitter).

## Age

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/age.jpg"
  title="Age of Respondents" %}

> At this point, the oldest respondent (54 year old) can be the youngest respondent’s grandfather... (13 years old)

## Gender

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/sex.svg"
  title="Gender" %}

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/gender.svg"
  title="Cisgender vs Transgender" %}

7.5% of the respondents are non-male and 5.9% are transgender.

Female/Non-Binary/Other Respondents and Where to Find them

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/other-gender-country.jpg"
  title="Countries of Female/Non-Binary/Other Respondents" %}

## Country

Top 3 countries are Taiwan (153), United States (91) and Philippines (38).

It is clear that East Asia is the most important market for the game (being culturally close to Japan), followed by Southeast Asia and North America.

I think the most surprising fact to me is how many more Taiwan respondents I have gotten after translating the survey to Chinese.

Despite the largest expected player base of this game being Japan, this survey still was not able to capture the same proportion of Japanese players (only 22). I just don’t know where these Japanese people are lurking.

China should also be a pretty big player base of this game, but because the survey was conducted via Google Forms, people living in China cannot access Google websites unless they use VPN. It does not mean that there are very few China LAH players.

## Japanese proficiency

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/jp.svg"
  title="Japanese Language Proficiency" %}

After using the same question setup for the fourth time, this was the first time that I realised that it was not well designed. Many people who self-taught the Japanese language but did not sit for standardised Japanese language exams like JLPT report “Zero knowledge” instead of estimating the JLPT level that is close to their current ability.

The original purpose of this question was merely to estimate the overall Japanese reading ability of the player base (to highlight how much market share LifeWonders is missing for not translating the game), rather than really wanting to know the formal qualification of the respondents.

Therefore, this question will be revamped next year, which mean I also have to remove the “fundoshi” option (*sob*).

# The Game

## Actual Player

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/play_lah.svg"
  title="Do you play Live A Hero?" %}

Despite having more than double the amount of respondents for this year’s survey, the percentage of actual players remains pretty high.

We can see that Gyee has the highest number of “abandoned” counts, followed by Crave Saga.

## Playing Time

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/play-lah-time.jpg"
  title="How Long Have Live A Hero Players Been Playing the Game?" %}

X-axis is the number of days played (end date is set to 30 Sep 2024). Slightly less than half of the respondents started playing Live A Hero immediately after the game’s launch. Since then, the player base seems to be growing at a linear scale.

There are small bumps near every 360 days, likely due to the anniversary bringing more players than other times of the year.

I want to emphasize that this probably is not the actual overall market growth rate of the game, since by right the actual player base should be predominantly Japanese, and the sample group of this survey has very few Japanese.

This linear scale is likely more for oversea players, whose growth is limited due to language barrier. We shall see again if the trend changes next year when official translation is finally implemented.

## Main Character Configuration

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/body.svg"
  title="Main character body type" %}

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/voice_actor.svg"
  title="Main character voice" %}

Interesting points:
Female respondents (cis and trans) mostly only choose human body types.
There are cis-male respondents who choose female body types (straight players?!)

Hiroki (first male voice) took nearly 50% of the male voice’s market, the other two are about 25% each, I think this might be due to the power of default choice.

For female voice, Yui Toita is slightly more popular than Orie Kimoto.

## Money spending

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/in-app-purchase.jpg"
  title="How Many Live A Hero Player Spend Money In-game?" %}

- It seems that those who do spend money in this game pretty much will buy all of the in-app purchase (but we don't know how frequent they do it via this question).
- We also don't know how many players bought both the small and large event limited stone packs.

To help make other visualizations easier to understand, we will introduce the concept of “spending level” here.

### Definition of Spending level

- Medium-Heavy: those who had bought the event-limited stone pack and/or regular-priced stones
  - Because the question did not ask how often people bought stone packs, it is hard to further differentiate “those that buy stone pack(s) in every event” vs “those that only spend once or twice in their entire experience”.
- Light: those who only bought the anniversary pack and/or new year grab bag (i.e. spent only once or twice a year)
- Minimal: only bought the ten paid stones for fourth Sales slot
- No: never spent a single cent in this game

The criteria for each spending level may be a little arbitrary, but it is enough to get a sense of the general trend.

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/spending-overall.jpg"
  title="How Many Live A Hero Player Spend Money In-game?" %}

More than 50% of the players actually spend at least some amount of money in Live A Hero.

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/spending-region.jpg"
  title="How Many Live A Hero Player Spend Money In-game? (by Region)" %}

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/spending-east-asia.jpg"
  title="How Many Live A Hero Player Spend Money In-game? (East Asia)" %}

East Asia has the highest percentage of Live A Hero players that spend money in-game. Given that, you can see why LifeWonders advertise a lot to East Asia countries like Taiwan.

## Gameplay Style

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/login-overall.jpg"
  title="How Live A Hero Players Play the Game?" %}

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/login-spending-percentage.jpg"
  title="\"How Live A Hero Players Play the Game\" against \"Spending Level\"" %}

Those who play the game in the most earnest way (last tier) are more likely to be paying customer too

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/login-other-gender.jpg"
  title="How Live A Hero Players Play the Game (Female / Non-binary / Other)" %}

- Among non-male players, slightly more only play the game occasionally compared to the male counterpart
- Female players are less likely to optimize their game play to the maximum compared to other groups.

## Game Elements’ Ranking

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/game-score.jpg"
  title="Live A Hero Game Element's Score" %}

Unsurprisingly, character is the most important aspect of the game according to the players.

> Once again, my original word choice of “rank” in the question had confused some people. I actually just want people to give a score to each game element (which mean two game elements can both be scored “3”) instead of really ranking each game element by different rank

> This means that some people might have answered the question in a way that did not align with my original intention.

## Other games

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/play-other-game.jpg"
  title="What Other lGbt Games Played by Live A Hero Players" %}

268 LAH players have played Gyee before but most of them have abandoned it. 242 LAH players have heard of the game, but probably got scared by the testimonial of past Gyee players that they never bother to try it.

Fantastic Boyfriends (F彼) being a buy-out game developed by LifeWonders, you can treat “abandoned” the same as “still playing”. It is not surprising that plenty of respondents said “they heard of it but never played it”, since the majority of the respondents do not understand Japanese and the game has no hope of ever getting official translation.

66.8% of LAH players are still playing Tokyo Afterschool Summoners, which is also another older game developed by LifeWonders, while 23.9% have abandoned it.

Tamacolle has the highest number of respondents who have “never heard of” the game and also the lowest abandoned / still playing count.

Sizable number of respondents have at least tried playing Another Eidos and Crave Saga (372 and 303 respectively), but the former seem more able to retain players. They are gay gacha games that have R18 content. and provide some form of translation, but from what I have seen, Another Eidos’ translation quality is much higher than Crave Saga.

Maybe next year I should add questions to rate the story, characters and general satisfaction of these games too.

## Free Gacha Pull Currency

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/gacha_stone.svg"
  title="Free Gacha Pull Currency Opinion" %}

55.2% of the LAH players think the game gives less free gacha pulls than other gacha games, while only 9.8% of them think LAH is more generous than other gacha games.


Let’s hear players that have tried other gacha games have to say:

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/gacha-stone-other-game2.jpg"
  title="Free Gacha Pull Currency Opinion against Other Games" %}

it seems that only LAH players that have tried Another Eidos have some different patterns between the “less” and “more” group: in the “more generous” group, higher percentage of those from “more generous” group have abandoned Another Eidos than that of the “less generous” group (but we do not know if they are indeed using Another Eidos as the comparison).

(Tamacolle also shows a different pattern between the “less” and “more” group, but since the game does not require spending money to pull characters, I don’t think it really matters).

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/gacha-stone-spending.jpg"
  title="Free Gacha Pull Currency Opinion against Spending Level" %}

It is clear that even among players that have spent money in this game, we still have more of them feeling the game is less generous with free gacha pulls than other gacha games, this opinion is not just limited to those free-to-play players.

## Translation

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/translation.jpg"
  title="Translation Prediction" %}

Once again, we celebrate another game anniversary without official translation, which means 27.2% of the respondents made the correct prediction.

LifeWonders said that they are still working on it and implore us to wait a little longer, but what “a little longer” really means may be up for debate.

Half of the people (median value) believe that LifeWonders would translate at most all the Main Quest stories till 1st anniversary.

## Read story

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/read-story.svg"
  title="Does Live A Hero Player Read Story In-game?" %}

From the feedback I have received after publishing the survey, I should have added one more option for “Yes, I read the story in-game with the help of machine translation and some guesswork”.

## What-if

The next two questions really stemmed from my frustration that despite having a few more new games entering the space of gay gacha games over the last 2 years, none seem to really threaten LifeWonders’ market share in a meaningful way, so LifeWonders seems very comfortable about not improving their monetization strategy.

Therefore, I want to use these two questions to see if the market are willing to explore other kind of game format and monetization.

### Buy-out games

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/buy-out.jpg"
  title="Do Live A Hero Players Support Buy-out Game?" %}

- Need translation
- Must have hote men/furries
- I thought that is literally what LifeWonders main brand about
- R18 content
- Must have good gameplay
- Diverse range of game illustrators
- I don't play the game if it has the no catharsis ending
- A more in-depth character customization that cannot be done (can only be simplified) in a non-gacha game
- If LifeWonders makes it, I will buy it
- See, LifeWonders brand does invoke some confidence now
- Less/no female
- Playable on iPhone X

In case LifeWonders is not convinced that this statistics is not representing those who actually spend money in game, let me create another chart with only Live A Hero Players that spent money in-game

### R-18 games

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/r18.jpg"
  title="Do Live A Hero Players Support R18 Game?" %}

Other comments in no particular order:

- Hot and sexy men
- Need translation
- Less or even completely without censorship
- Need good writing to develop relationship with characters before going R18
- R18 is only a good to have, other part of the game needs to be good too
- Characters need to be have personality that are more than just their dicks and asses
- Plot needs to follow common logic
- No underage characters
- Auto play/skip stages
- Settings to disable certain kink content
  - <span class="comment">I think this is totally reasonable if we want diverse sex kink (even hardcore ones) but still accommodate to different kind of players</span>
- If main character is meant to be self-insert, need settings to specify player’s sexuality
- Furries should not be minority in the selection
- Must no catharsis ending and No tragic, grotesque, cruel ending with no reason
- Also have CGs that are not R18
- Can only choose furries
- Old men
- Playable on iPhone X
- No female characters at all, cannot choose female main character, cannot have sex with female characters
  - <span class="comment">I am totally not surprised to see this comment</span>
- Don’t end up in a situation where certain characters have way less arts than other, don’t hire artists that has known bad history
  - <span class="comment">We all know which artists they are referring to...</span>
- BomBom main character
- Main character customization
- More brain rot comment about Sadayoshi

> Before we start, I realized that once again some people misunderstood my intention for setting the “top 10 favourites” question. Many people who have less than 10 “all favourites” thought they still need to choose exactly 10 characters for “top 10” question, but actually I wanted people to choose “at most 10 characters among their all favourites”: if you have chose less than 10 characters in first question, you should just same set of characters for the second question.

Comments:

- Muscular male furry characters once again dominated the popularity ranking, with {% chara_link Pubraseer %} being the top, while {% chara_link Barrel %} and {% chara_link Monomasa %} taking the second and third place with just one vote in difference.
- The gap between first place and second place is much more significant.
- {% chara_link Tsuneaki %} and {% chara_link Sterio %} are pretty high on the ranking too, perhaps due to recency biases as they are featured in the event when the survey was running.

As we move on to “top 10 favourites” popularity ranking, we can see that it often favours the older characters more. {% chara_link Tsuneaki %} and {% chara_link Sterio %}’s ranking somewhat dropped, while {% chara_link Gaius %} experienced the largest ranking boost this way.

Comments

- It seems that characters that gotten their variant between the time when 2023 and 2024 surveys was carried out (such as {% chara_link Polaris Mask %}, {% chara_link Lilac %}, {% chara_link Kalaski %})
- {% chara_link Tsuneaki %} have their ranking boosted quite significantly, further proving that the amount of character appearance in story and recency biases do play a role in their ranking.

- The sample size is not large, but I think it is not wrong to speculate that Japan players are also mostly furry-lovers.
- {% chara_link Alchiba %} gets the biggest boost, jumping from 37th place to 12th place in "top 10" favourites ranking.

<summary>Female / Non-binary / Other respondents</summary>

The number of non-male respondents is small to begin with, so there are a lot of ties in votes.

{% chara_link Pubraseer %} are not the number 1 among these respondents, but still in the top 3. This character is just really well loved in all segment of the player base.

For female respondents, {% chara_link Sensettia %} is number 1 in “All favourites” ranking when they can choose as many characters as want, but {% chara_link Flamier %} overtake her by one vote in “top 10” ranking.

{% chara_link Barrel %} is only at 17th place in “All favourites” ranking, but shot up to TODO. This is quite aligned with what I observed in social media, where most Barrel fan arts are paired with the main character in the female human form.

{% chara_link reXer %}, {% chara_link Grigory %} also saw significant ranking boost in “Top 10” ranking.

Using association rules with min confidence > 60%

There are clearly some sort of clusters formed by “Muscular male humans”, “Muscular male furries” and “Chubby male furries”.
People who put Melide in their top 10 tend to also have Monomasa in the list
Obviously all male furries point to Pubraseer

The popularity poll clearly shows that the game has successfully captured the market that likes muscular male and furries, but has the game captured market that like other kind of characters? We are going to find out with other metrics.

- {% chara_link Victom %} and {% chara_link Danzo %} (mecha hunks)
- {% chara_link Yuhang %}, {% chara_link Santetsu %} and {% chara_link Grigory %} (plus size men)

# Free form questions

For the next two questions, the volume of the feedback is simply too big for me to go through one by one, so I used ChatGPT to summarize them (and even then I had to do it in a few batches because the total text length exceeds ChatGPT’s limit...)

The “number of mentions” should be treated more as an estimation rather than absolute value. <span class="comment">Words coloured in blue are my own</span>.

      *  <span class="comment">I think this might apply more to new players, because old players tend to hoard a lot of resources over time and be selective in which units to upgrade. Crave Saga provides a lot more beginner missions <span class="masked">and paid packs</span> to help new players to catch up, so I think LAH can learn from that too.</span>

5. **Stamina System Improvements** (9 mentions)
  * The stamina system is seen as restrictive, with slow recovery times and high stamina costs for grinding stages.

## Feedback for the Survey and Wiki

Thank you for all the kind words about the wiki and the survey. There was also one person from Japan who apparently is a contributor to the LAH JP Wiki. <span class="masked">Yeah, sometimes wikis just copy stuff from each other don’t we.</span>

And on to the other feedbacks and suggestions

### Character profile, voice line not translated

We used to have a few more contributors to work on translation, but now we are just down to one. We just need more contributors...

### Voice/BGM audio files, Spine animation on Wiki

Firstly, this Wiki is hosted on Github Pages with only 1GB free storage, so I don’t have a lot of leeway to work with. Secondly, LifeWonders don’t really like people sharing audio files widely (this is in their Terms of Service).

If you know where to look, you can already find voice/BGMs in certain websites, but I cannot tell you where they are as the owner of this wiki.

### Skill description are hard to read

Many people complain that the skill descriptions in Wiki are more wordy than the original Japanese game text, like `[base skill] Deal 60% of damage to target enemy/100%` instead of just `Deal 60% damage to target enemy`.

To explain that, here is a bit of history:

1. The early contributors of this Wiki (myself included) were the same people that contributed to [Housamo wiki](https://housamo.wiki) (and later the [Housamo Skill DB](https://housamo-skill.netlify.app/)). We had the tradition of generating skill description by parsing game data and output description in a certain format to expose the most intricate details of the game mechanism
1. That method worked well with Housamo even till today, the Wiki can auto generate most of the skill descriptions with minimal human intervention when game maintenance hasn't even ended.
1. However, LAH’s game mechanism evolved more wildly than Housamo. There were almost always new mechanisms added to LAH after every game maintenance.
1. We began to see more and more crazy “system status counters”, “various types of skill triggers”, “one skill adding a new skill to another target”, “weird skill timing” and so on. Trying to maintain the algorithm to parse this kind of game data to generate human-readable descriptions becomes more and more infeasible.
1. We obviously received a lot of complaints about the readability of the skill descriptions, and no good solution to fix, to the point where one day I just decided that some complicated skills will just be manually written by human contributors instead. However, we still wanted to keep most of the old machine-generated descriptions there, because at that time, we didn't have that kind of manpower to rewrite those too manually (remember that all these works are unpaid).

Around October this year, I made a bold decision to abandon the old system to generate skill descriptions automatically, and instead develop a new system to translate skill descriptions in a way that is more aligned with actual game UI. Fortunately, a few volunteers joined the effort, so now newer characters’ skills should have more readable descriptions, and the new system will be more prepared to welcome official translations when it happens.

### List of XXX

I think many people didn’t know these pages exist:

- [Misc lists](/misc/)
- [List of statuses that ever exist in game](/statuses/)
  - We might prepare something better for list of common buff/debuff in the future
- [List of game items](/items/)

### There should be a way to jump for game app to Wiki

... Do some people actually think that this Wiki is operating in an official way, and I am a LifeWonders’ employee?!

### Discord role where we get notified that stocks get refilled

I think you should just follow the official X (Twitter) account

### Gameplay tier list, recommendation and strategy guide like JP Wiki

Since LAH JP Wiki kind of has it (like clarifying mechanism of certain unit, what hero/sidekick is good for this unit and why), I am not totally against having gameplay guide in this wiki. It is just that there are no volunteer who would write it.

### Filter characters by buff / debuff

We might implement such thing in the future for a few common buff/debuff statuses.

### Survey question suggestions

- Top 1 favourite question
- Favourite human / furry / female / costume / variant / event / artist / voice actors
  - New question for human / furry / female will require repeating that long list of characters in the survey. I am afraid that will increase the respondents’ fatigue. There are already people complaining that the list is too long to navigate in Google Form
  - People may have very different standard when judging best costume / variant, most will ended up just choosing their favourite characters, so the questions become quite pointless
  - Proof: [X/Twitter Fashion Poll](https://x.com/BarrelCrankrack/status/1842968014620434859)
    - {% chara_link  Sadayoshi %} is somehow top 5 fashionable characters, despite the fact that “not knowing much about being fashionable" is kind of coded into his personality (excluding his variant costume which was partly thanks to {% chara_link Maculata %}'s design).
- Characters pairing
  - Right now I can’t think of how to set up this kind of question on Google Form since this is “one question that has two inputs”. I also cannot trust that everyone can spell names correctly. If I were to make it as one text input, enforcing text format and fixing typos would be a nightmare.

### More organized list of fan translations

We collect what we can on the wiki, but to be honest there really aren’t that many English fan translations for this game to begin with.

- For event/main quest translation, see [https://housamosummaries.blogspot.com/](https://housamosummaries.blogspot.com/).
- For event special quest fan translations, they are usually listed in the event info page.
- For character quest fan translations, see [Character Quests](https://liveahero-wiki.github.io/chara_quests/)

### Survey needs Traditional Chinese/Spanish translation

Unfortunately that is just not practical. With just three languages (English, Simplified Chinese and Japanese), the survey already looks very cluttered, adding one more language will further impact the readability of the survey.

### Story lore section

Contribution welcomed. We also need the origin of character names.

### Comment section for gameplay

I would suggest you to just ask help in LAH Discord (unofficial), there are many good players that give you better advice more quickly.

# Afterword

I hope you enjoy reading this report, because the whole process took me months to prepare. Many times the thought of “I should be paid for this work” flashed in my mind. It really is not easy to conduct a survey of this size, and then write a report about it!

For a lGbt game that we all know caters more towards gay players, I think LifeWonders’ success in attracting more players from other demographics is pretty commendable. If they can grow the group of paying players to keep the business running [while still staying true to their original mission](https://www.lifewonders.co.jp/?lang=en), I think that is good for everyone.

## Data sanitization

Given the sample size, it is not surprising that we might have responses that look suspicious. I will talk about some of the measures I took to sieve the responses.

### Suspicious responses

- A transgender girl from Antarctica, has JLPT N1 level but does not play the game, and requested an English translation for the game.
  - What is the probability that this combination actually exists in the world?? How many people were born in Antarctica, some more being a transgender? If you have achieved JLPT N1 level, you probably can play the game and read its story without English translation. This response was submitted after I had already added clarification on JLPT levels and other standardized Japanese language tests, the person clearly did not read the questions properly.
- Someone who found the survey via “Atlantis”, born in the Philippines but claiming to be a Japanese native speaker, and the person’s “Top 10” and “All favourites” have no intersection
  - This response was also removed

### Removing duplicate responses

Majority of the responses I had to remove fall under this category. Usually they are detected when I see the same set of comments/favourite selections appear in multiple responses.

There might be even more duplicate responses, but eliminating them all is beyond my capability. I believe there are not that many duplicates to affect the overall result significantly.

### People just don’t read instructions!

For optional questions, please leave them blank if you have no comment, and I specifically said “don’t write N/A”, yet I still get some “N/A”, “No”, “None” and their equivalent in other languages for those questions.

For the “when did you start playing Live A Hero” question, despite already stating that the game launched on 30 September 2020, there are still people who claim to have played the game before this date, some even as far back as the year 1998.

And then we also have someone who claims to be 500 years old (maybe he was trying to type “50” instead).
