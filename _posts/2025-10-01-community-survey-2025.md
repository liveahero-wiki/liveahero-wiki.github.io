# Foreword

We have achieved 606 responses in this year’s survey, more than twice the amount from last year’s iteration!

Thank you to those who have helped me spread the word on various social media platforms!

This is the first time I have coded up an entire survey platform from scratch:

- No longer depends on Google Form, so China users can see the survey without using VPN
- More custom question types that are not available with Google Form (e.g. character ranking question, copying answers between questions)
- More data points to detect possible duplicate/spam responses

Special thanks to 無理 for helping to check Japanese translation in the survey.

## Disclaimer on Limitation of the Survey

The demographics percentage of this year's respondents is very different from past few years, in that the percentage of East Asians became more than half of the total respondents, and the number of English-speaking respondents also have decreased.
This means that many "2024 vs 2025" comparsion does not really tell, because the underlying group of respondents are quite different.

Despite . In fact Japanese is the only group that has ever shown a very hostile reaction towards this survey.

I understand that some people do not want to see the popularity poll result as there might be jerks
So let me get this straight:

1. "Some characters being more popular than others" is a fact that everyone can observe through many other ways, such as "engagement count on ", the number of fan arts and so on. Even without this popularity poll, . The result should not increase the number of such group.
1. I have ran this survey for many years. While I can't say there weren't people , I have not witnessed such discourse escalated too much, because most groups and servers already have rules to control insults and hate speech.
1. For those people who twist the result of popularity poll for their narrative, I am sure these people do other Karen stuffs in other time too. So the general online advise applies: if the person is being too annoying, just block them and move on with your life.


# Respondent Profile

## Source of respondents

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/source.svg"
  title="Source of Respondents" %}

Majority of the respondents found the survey via 

## Age

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/age.jpg"
  title="Age of Respondents" %}

Since this is a mobile gacha game, it is no surprise that the age distribution is skewed towards the younger side.

> At this point, the oldest respondent (54 year old) can be the youngest respondent’s grandfather... (13 years old)

## Gender

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/sex.svg"
  title="Gender" %}

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/gender.svg"
  title="Cisgender vs Transgender" %}

7.5% of the respondents are non-male and 5.9% are transgender. Both are higher than the previous year.

### Female/Non-Binary/Other Respondents and Where to Find them

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/other-gender-country.jpg"
  title="Countries of Female/Non-Binary/Other Respondents" %}

## Country

Top 3 countries are Taiwan (153), China and Japan

Transparency report:

- One person from "Christmas Island" uses USA ip address
- One person from "Sierra Leone" uses Malaysia ip address
- Many people from "China" use ip address from various other countries, but that is kind of expected since China has the Great Firewall, or they have migrated permanently

It is clear that East Asia is the most important market for the game (being culturally close to Japan), followed by Southeast Asia and North America.

I think the most surprising fact to me is how many more Taiwan respondents I have gotten after translating the survey to Chinese.

Despite the largest expected player base of this game being Japan, this survey still was not able to capture the same proportion of Japanese players (only 22). I just don’t know where these Japanese people are lurking.

China should also be a pretty big player base of this game, but because the survey was conducted via Google Forms, people living in China cannot access Google websites unless they use VPN. It does not mean that there are very few China LAH players.

## Japanese proficiency

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/jp.svg"
  title="Japanese Language Proficiency" %}

31.4% of the respondents cannot read Japanese at all, while slightly more than half of the respondents can read some basic Japanese words.

All in all, those who has the ability to read the in-game Japanese story is still less than a quarter.

# The Game

## Actual Player

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/play_lah.svg"
  title="Do you play Live A Hero?" %}

Despite having more than double the amount of respondents for this year’s survey, the percentage of actual players remains pretty high.

## Playing Time

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/play-lah-time.jpg"
  title="How Long Have Live A Hero Players Been Playing the Game?" %}

X-axis is the number of days played (end date is set to 30 Sep 2024). Slightly less than half of the respondents started playing Live A Hero immediately after the game’s launch. Since then, the player base seems to be growing at a linear scale.

There are small bumps near every 360 days, likely due to the anniversary bringing more players than other times of the year.

The bump at "last 720 days" is quite steep, which is roughly when 3rd anniversary happened. I suspect that there might be a lot of oversea players trying out the game when LifeWonders announced that they were working on official translation.


> This probably is not the actual overall market growth rate of the game, since by right the actual player base should be predominantly Japanese, and the sample group of this survey has very few Japanese.
>
> This linear scale is likely more for oversea players, whose growth is limited due to language barrier. We shall see again if the trend changes next year when official translation is finally implemented.

## Main Character Configuration

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/body.svg"
  title="Main character body type" %}

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/voice_actor.svg"
  title="Main character voice" %}

Hiroki Goto (first male voice) took nearly 50% of the male voice’s market, the other two are about 25% each. For female voice, Yui Toita is slightly more popular than Orie Kimoto.

Since Hiroki Goto and Yui Toita are the first male/female voice **in the order listed by the game**, I think many users choose them partly due to the [default effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_effect).

Interesting points:

- Female respondents (cis and trans) mostly only choose human body types.
- There are cis-male respondents who choose female body types (straight players?!).

## Money spending

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/in-app-purchase.jpg"
  title="How Many Live A Hero Player Spend Money In-game?" %}

- It seems that those who do spend money in this game pretty much will buy all other types of in-app purchase (but we can't know how frequent they do so via this question).
- We also don't know how many players bought both the small and large event limited stone packs.

To help make other visualizations easier to understand, we will introduce the concept of **spending level** here.

### Definition of Spending level

|Grade|Description|
|-|-|
|XL| those who had bought regular paid stones (more expensive) |
|L| those who had bought the event-limited gem pack (large) |
|M| those who had bought the event-limited gem pack (small) |
|S| only bought the anniversary pack and/or new year grab bag (i.e. spent only once or twice a year) |
|XS| only bought the ten paid stones for fourth Sales slot |
|Zero| never spent money in this game |

The criteria for each spending level isn't completely accurate as we don't count how often people buy each product, but it is enough to get a sense of the general trend.

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/spending-overall.jpg"
  title="How Many Live A Hero Player Spend Money In-game?" %}

More than 50% of the players actually spend at least some amount of money in Live A Hero. Completely free-to-play players are less than what I originally thought.

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/spending-region.jpg"
  title="How Many Live A Hero Player Spend Money In-game? (by Region)" %}

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/spending-east-asia.jpg"
  title="How Many Live A Hero Player Spend Money In-game? (East Asia)" %}

East Asia has the highest percentage of Live A Hero players that spend money in-game. Other developed economies like United States and Europe also have high percentage of paying players.

## Gameplay Style

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/login-overall.jpg"
  title="How Live A Hero Players Play the Game?" %}

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/login-spending-percentage.jpg"
  title="\"How Live A Hero Players Play the Game\" against \"Spending Level\"" %}

- About 75% of the players login at least once a day.
- About 55% of the players will make sure all AP are used.
- Those who play the game in the most earnest way (last tier) are more likely to be paying customer too.

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/login-other-gender.jpg"
  title="How Live A Hero Players Play the Game (Female / Non-binary / Other)" %}

- Among non-male players, slightly more only play the game occasionally compared to the male counterpart
- Female players are less likely to optimize their game play to the maximum compared to other groups.

## High Difficulty Quest

## Game Elements’ Rating

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/game-score.jpg"
  title="Live A Hero Game Element's Score" %}

Unsurprisingly, character is the most important aspect of the game according to the players.

## Other games

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/play-other-game.jpg"
  title="What Other lGbt Games Played by Live A Hero Players" %}

268 LAH players have played Gyee before but most of them have abandoned it. 242 LAH players have heard of the game, but probably got scared by the testimonial of past Gyee players that they never bother to try it.

Fantastic Boyfriends (F彼) being a buy-out game developed by LifeWonders, you can treat “abandoned” the same as “still playing”. It is not surprising that plenty of respondents said “they heard of it but never played it”, since the majority of the respondents do not understand Japanese and the game has no hope of ever getting official translation.

66.8% of LAH players are still playing Tokyo Afterschool Summoners, which is also another older game developed by LifeWonders, while 23.9% have abandoned it.

Tamacolle has the highest number of respondents who have “never heard of” the game and also the lowest abandoned / still playing count.

Sizable number of respondents have at least tried playing Another Eidos and Crave Saga (372 and 303 respectively), but the former seem more able to retain players. They are gay gacha games that have R18 content. and provide some form of translation, but from what I have seen, Another Eidos’ translation quality is much higher than Crave Saga.

Maybe next year I should add questions to rate the story, characters and general satisfaction of these games too.

## Free Gacha Pull Currency

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/gacha_stone.svg"
  title="Free Gacha Pull Currency Opinion" %}

55.2% of the LAH players think the game gives less free gacha pulls than other gacha games, while only 9.8% of them think LAH is more generous than other gacha games.


Let’s hear players that have tried other gacha games have to say:

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/gacha-stone-other-game2.jpg"
  title="Free Gacha Pull Currency Opinion against Other Games" %}

It seems that only LAH players that have tried Another Eidos have some different patterns between the “less” and “more” group: in the “more generous” group, higher percentage of those from “more generous” group have abandoned Another Eidos than that of the “less generous” group (but we do not know if they are indeed using Another Eidos as the comparison).

(Tamacolle also shows a different pattern between the “less” and “more” group, but since the game does not require spending money to pull characters, I don’t think it really matters).

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/gacha-stone-spending.jpg"
  title="Free Gacha Pull Currency Opinion against Spending Level" %}

It is clear that even among players that have spent money in this game, we still have more of them feeling the game is less generous with free gacha pulls than other gacha games, this opinion is not just limited to those free-to-play players.

## Translation

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/translation.jpg"
  title="Translation Prediction" %}

Once again, we celebrate another game anniversary without official translation, which means 27.2% of the respondents made the correct prediction.

This number is much higher than last anniversary (27.2%), you can see that oversea players had lost faith in LifeWonders when they failed to fulfill their promise in last anniversary.

Half of the people (median value) believe that LifeWonders would translate at most all the Main Quest stories till 1st anniversary.

## Read story

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/read-story.svg"
  title="Do Live A Hero Player Read Story In-game?" %}

More than half of the respondents need to rely on fan translation (which are only available for some quests).

> From the feedback I have received after publishing the survey, I should have added one more option for “Yes, I read the story in-game with the help of machine translation and some guesswork”.

The next two questions really stemmed from my frustration that despite having a few more new games entering the space of gay gacha games over the last 2 years, none seem to really threaten LifeWonders’ market share in a meaningful way, so LifeWonders seems very comfortable about not improving their monetization strategy.

Therefore, I want to use these two questions to see if the market are willing to explore other kind of game format and monetization.

### Buy-out games

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/buy-out.jpg"
  title="Do Live A Hero Players Support Buy-out Game?" %}

Other comments in no particular order:

- Need translation
- Must have hot men/furries
- I thought that is literally what LifeWonders main brand about
- R18 content
- Must have good gameplay
- Diverse range of game illustrators
- I don't play the game if it has the no catharsis ending
- A more in-depth character customization that cannot be done (can only be simplified) in a non-gacha game
- If LifeWonders makes it, I will buy it
- See, LifeWonders brand does invoke some confidence now
- Less/no female
- Playable on iPhone X

In case LifeWonders is not convinced that this statistics is not representing those who actually spend money in game, let me create another chart with **only Live A Hero Players that spent money in-game**.

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/buy-out-spending.jpg"
  title="Do Live A Hero Players Support Buy-out Game? (those who spent money in Live A Hero)" %}

It is clear that LifeWonders will still get real money if they release buy-out games. Most paying players are willing to give buy-out game from LifeWonders a try.

### R-18 games

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/r18.jpg"
  title="Do Live A Hero Players Support R18 Game?" %}

Other comments in no particular order:

- Hot and sexy men
- Need translation
- Less or even completely without censorship
- Need good writing to develop relationship with characters before going R18
- R18 is only a good to have, other part of the game needs to be good too
- Characters need to be have personality that are more than just their dicks and asses

Top spots for “All favourites” popularity ranking for each category

> {% chara_link  Player %} is not included in this table because they fit in all categories

Comments:

- Muscular male furry characters once again dominated the popularity ranking, with {% chara_link Pubraseer %} being the top, while {% chara_link Barrel %} and {% chara_link Monomasa %} taking the second and third place with just one vote in difference.
- The gap between first place and second place is much more significant.
- {% chara_link Tsuneaki %} and {% chara_link Sterio %} are pretty high on the ranking too, perhaps due to recency biases as they are featured in the event when the survey was running.

As we move on to “top 10 favourites” popularity ranking, we can see that it often favours the older characters more. {% chara_link Tsuneaki %} and {% chara_link Sterio %}’s ranking somewhat dropped, while {% chara_link Gaius %} experienced the largest ranking boost this way.

- It seems that characters that gotten their variant forms between the time when 2023 and 2024 surveys were carried out (such as {% chara_link Polaris Mask %}, {% chara_link Lilac %}, {% chara_link Kalaski %} and {% chara_link Tsuneaki %}) have their ranking boosted quite significantly
  - This further suggests that the amount of character appearance in story and recency biases do play a role in their ranking.

- The sample size is not large, but I think it is not wrong to speculate that Japan players are also mostly furry-lovers.
- {% chara_link Alchiba %} gets the biggest boost, jumping from 37th place to 12th place in "top 10" favourites ranking.

The number of non-male respondents is small to begin with, so there are a lot of ties in votes.

{% chara_link Pubraseer %} is not the number 1 among these respondents, but still in the top 3. This character is just really well loved in all segment of the player base.

For female respondents, {% chara_link Sensettia %} is number 1 in “All favourites” ranking when they can choose as many characters as want, but {% chara_link Flamier %} overtake her by one vote in “top 10” ranking. {% chara_link Tsuneaki %} is number in "Top 10" ranking.

{% chara_link Barrel %} is only at 17th place in “All favourites” ranking, but shot up to 3rd place in "Top 10" among female respondents. This is quite aligned with what I observed in social media, where most Barrel fan arts are paired with the main character in the female human form.

{% chara_link reXer %}, {% chara_link Grigory %} also saw significant ranking boost in “Top 10” ranking.

In this gacha game that is full of baits for thirsty players, let us applaud these people who can limit the amount of characters they devote their hearts for.

{% chara_link Gaius %}, {% chara_link Canes %} and {% chara_link Player %} are ranked much higher by those who chose less than 10 favourites.

# Free form questions

For the **next three questions**, the volume of the feedback is simply too big for me to go through one by one, so I used ChatGPT to summarize them (and even then I had to do it in a few batches because the total text length exceeds ChatGPT’s limit...)

The “number of mentions” should be treated more as an estimation rather than absolute value. <span class="comment">Words coloured in blue are my own</span>.

# Afterword

I hope you enjoy reading this report, because the whole process took me months to prepare. Many times the thought of “I should be paid for this work” flashed in my mind. It really is not easy to conduct a survey of this size, and then write a report about it!

For a lGbt game that we all know caters more towards gay players, I think LifeWonders’ success in attracting more players from other demographics is pretty commendable. If they can grow the group of paying players to keep the business running [while still staying true to their original mission](https://www.lifewonders.co.jp/?lang=en), I think that is good for everyone. (Ironically, "serving global market is also in their missions).

While waiting for the ever elusive release of official translation, this wiki will still be here supporting oversea players.

See you in next year survey!
