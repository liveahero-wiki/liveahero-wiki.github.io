# Foreword

We have achieved 596 responses in this year’s survey, slightly less than last year's survey.

Thank you to those who have helped me spread the word on various social media platforms!

This is the first time I have coded up an entire survey platform from scratch:

- No longer depends on Google Form, so China users can see the survey without using VPN
- More custom question types that are not available with Google Form (e.g. character ranking question, copying answers between questions)
- More data points to detect possible duplicate/spam responses

Special thanks to 無理 for helping to check Japanese translation in the survey.

## Disclaimer on Limitation of the Survey

The demographics percentage of this year's respondents is very different from past few years, in that the percentage of East Asians became more than half of the total respondents, and the absolute number of non East-Asian respondents also have decreased.
This means that many "2024 vs 2025" comparsions do not really tell if there is a sentiment change for the same group of people, because the underlying group of respondents are quite different. Take the comparison with a pinch of salt.

Despite trying my best to make the survey more user-friendly to Japanese and some Japanese Twitter/BlueSky users helping to repost the survey, we still failed to attract enough Japanese respondents.
This is also the first time I tried to publish the survey in Wikiwiki/Zawazawa. Although that did attract a few more Japanese respondents, I also received a lot of negative comments and downvotes from those anonymous users (ironically, I was the only forum user that uses an actual user name instead of just posting anonymously).
I have ran this survey for 5 years, and this is the first time I received such hostility.

I do not know if "Japanese people who were willing to participate in this survey" and "Japanese people who were very against to this survey" do not also have very different opinions about the questions of this survey, so all the Japan results below cannot meaningfully represent the overall Japan playerbase.

I understand that some people do not want to see the popularity poll result as there might be jerks who would cherry pick any data and twist it to fit their narrative.
So let me get this straight:

1. "Some characters being more popular than others" is a fact that everyone can observe through many other ways, such as "engagement count on LifeWonders' official posts/videos", "the number of fan arts" and so on. Even without this popularity poll, people who would cherry pick any data and twist it to fit their narrative always exist. The survey result should not increase the number of such people.
1. I have ran this survey for many years. While I can't say that everyone acted civil after the result publication, but I have not witnessed such discourse escalated too much, because most groups and servers already have rules to control insults and hate speech.
1. For those people who twist the result of popularity poll for their nown arrative, I am sure these people do other Karen stuffs in other time too. So the general online advise applies: if the person is being too annoying, just block them and move on with your life.


# Respondent Profile

## Source of respondents

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/source.svg"
  title="Source of Respondents" %}

Majority of the respondents found the survey via Discord (23.49%). Taiwan Bahamut Forum, Twitter/X and English Wiki each take approximately 15%.

## Age

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/age.jpg"
  title="Age of Respondents" %}

Since this is a mobile gacha game, it is no surprise that the age distribution is skewed towards the younger side.

At this point, the oldest respondent (55 year old) can be the youngest respondent’s grandfather... (13 years old)

## Gender

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/sex.svg"
  title="Gender" %}

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/gender.svg"
  title="Cisgender vs Transgender" %}

11.24% of the respondents are non-male (up from 7.5% last year) and 3.52% are transgender (lower than last year)

### Female/Non-Binary/Other Respondents and Where to Find them

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/other-gender-country.jpg"
  title="Countries of Female/Non-Binary/Other Respondents" %}

## Country

Top 3 countries are Taiwan (153), China and Japan

Transparency report:

- One person from "Christmas Island" uses USA ip address
- One person from "Sierra Leone" uses Malaysia ip address
- Many people from "China" use ip address from various other countries, but that is kind of expected since China has the Great Firewall, or they have migrated permanently

It is clear that East Asia is the most important market for the game (being culturally close to Japan), followed by Southeast Asia and North America.

I think the most surprising fact to me is how many more Taiwan respondents I have gotten after translating the survey to Chinese.

Despite the largest expected player base of this game being Japan, this survey still was not able to capture the same proportion of Japanese players (only 22). I just don’t know where these Japanese people are lurking.

China should also be a pretty big player base of this game, but because the survey was conducted via Google Forms, people living in China cannot access Google websites unless they use VPN. It does not mean that there are very few China LAH players.

## Japanese proficiency

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/jp.svg"
  title="Japanese Language Reading Proficiency" %}

- 56.04% of the respondents cannot read Japanese at all.
- 106 respondents has N1-level reading ability (17.79%). If excluding Japanese people, only 21 respondents have N1-level reading ability (3.52%)
- I estimate that you need at least N3 to be able to rea the in-game Japanese story comfortably, only
  22.52% of the respondents fit in this category.

# The Game

## Actual Player

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/play_lah.svg"
  title="Do you play Live A Hero?" %}

Note:

- Usually people who do not play the game or has abandoned the game are naturally less likely to spend time filling up this survey, so the pie chart just tell you how much votes you might want to exclude when reading other data of this survey if you only care about the voices of those who currently still play the game

## Stop Reason

Among the respondents who has played the game but now has stopped playing, these are the reasons:

- No translation
- Lost interest/motivation
- Battle system is too complicated / unfamiliar with game mechanics
- Quit becasue respondent cannot pull the character they want
- Too little (free) pull currency
- Boring/monotonous grinding, no skip ticket, not enough reward
- Nothing to do after upgrading favourite character(s)
- Phone storage shortage
- Respondent also play other gacha games, no time to keep Live A Hero
- No NSFW element

## Platform

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2025/lah_survey_venn_chart.svg"
  title="Which platform(s) Players Use to Play Live A Hero" %}

Majority of the respondents use Android to play the game. Quite a few people use multiple platforms to play the game.

## Playing Time

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/play-lah-time.jpg"
  title="How Long Have Live A Hero Players Been Playing the Game?" %}

X-axis is the number of days played (end date is set to 30 Sep 2024). Slightly less than half of the respondents started playing Live A Hero immediately after the game’s launch. Since then, the player base seems to be growing at a linear scale.

There are small bumps near every 360 days, likely due to the anniversary bringing more players than other times of the year.

The bump at "last 720 days" is quite steep, which is roughly when 3rd anniversary happened. I suspect that there might be a lot of oversea players trying out the game when LifeWonders announced that they were working on official translation.

## Main Character Configuration

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/body.svg"
  title="Main character body type" %}

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/voice_actor.svg"
  title="Main character voice" %}

Hiroki Goto (first male voice) took nearly 50% of the male voice’s market, the other two are about 25% each. For female voice, Yui Toita is slightly more popular than Orie Kimoto.

Since Hiroki Goto and Yui Toita are the first male/female voice **in the order listed by the game**, I think many users choose them partly due to the [default effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_effect).

Interesting points:

- Female respondents (cis and trans) mostly only choose human body types.
- There are cis-male respondents who choose female body types (straight players?!).

## Money spending

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/in-app-purchase.jpg"
  title="How Many Live A Hero Player Spend Money In-game?" %}

- It seems that those who do spend money in this game pretty much will buy all other types of in-app purchase (but we can't know how frequent they do so via this question).
- We also don't know how many players bought both the small and large event limited stone packs.

To help make other visualizations easier to understand, we will introduce the concept of **spending level** here.

### Definition of Spending level

|Grade|Description|
|-|-|
|XL| those who had bought regular paid stones (more expensive) |
|L| those who had bought the event-limited gem pack (large) |
|M| those who had bought the event-limited gem pack (small) |
|S| only bought the anniversary pack and/or new year grab bag (i.e. spent only once or twice a year) |
|XS| only bought the ten paid stones for fourth Sales slot |
|Zero| never spent money in this game |

The criteria for each spending level isn't completely accurate as we don't count how often people buy each product, but it is enough to get a sense of the general trend.

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/spending-overall.jpg"
  title="How Many Live A Hero Player Spend Money In-game?" %}

More than 50% of the players actually spend at least some amount of money in Live A Hero. Completely free-to-play players are less than what I originally thought.

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/spending-region.jpg"
  title="How Many Live A Hero Player Spend Money In-game? (by Region)" %}

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/spending-east-asia.jpg"
  title="How Many Live A Hero Player Spend Money In-game? (East Asia)" %}

East Asia has the highest percentage of Live A Hero players that spend money in-game. Other developed economies like United States and Europe also have high percentage of paying players.

## Gameplay Style

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/login-overall.jpg"
  title="How Live A Hero Players Play the Game?" %}

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/login-spending-percentage.jpg"
  title="\"How Live A Hero Players Play the Game\" against \"Spending Level\"" %}

- About 75% of the players login at least once a day.
- About 55% of the players will make sure all AP are used.
- Those who play the game in the most earnest way (last tier) are more likely to be paying customer too.

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/login-other-gender.jpg"
  title="How Live A Hero Players Play the Game (Female / Non-binary / Other)" %}

- Among non-male players, slightly more only play the game occasionally compared to the male counterpart
- Female players are less likely to optimize their game play to the maximum compared to other groups.

## High Difficulty Quest



## Game Elements’ Rating

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/game-score.jpg"
  title="Live A Hero Game Element's Score" %}

Unsurprisingly, character is the most important aspect of the game according to the players.

## Other games

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/play-other-game.jpg"
  title="What Other lGbt Games Played by Live A Hero Players" %}

268 LAH players have played Gyee before but most of them have abandoned it. 242 LAH players have heard of the game, but probably got scared by the testimonial of past Gyee players that they never bother to try it.

Fantastic Boyfriends (F彼) being a buy-out game developed by LifeWonders, you can treat “abandoned” the same as “still playing”. It is not surprising that plenty of respondents said “they heard of it but never played it”, since the majority of the respondents do not understand Japanese and the game has no hope of ever getting official translation.

66.8% of LAH players are still playing Tokyo Afterschool Summoners, which is also another older game developed by LifeWonders, while 23.9% have abandoned it.

Tamacolle has the highest number of respondents who have “never heard of” the game and also the lowest abandoned / still playing count.

Sizable number of respondents have at least tried playing Another Eidos and Crave Saga (372 and 303 respectively), but the former seem more able to retain players. They are gay gacha games that have R18 content. and provide some form of translation, but from what I have seen, Another Eidos’ translation quality is much higher than Crave Saga.

Maybe next year I should add questions to rate the story, characters and general satisfaction of these games too.

## Free Gacha Pull Currency

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/gacha_stone.svg"
  title="Free Gacha Pull Currency Opinion" %}

55.2% of the LAH players think the game gives less free gacha pulls than other gacha games, while only 9.8% of them think LAH is more generous than other gacha games.


Let’s hear players that have tried other gacha games have to say:

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/gacha-stone-other-game2.jpg"
  title="Free Gacha Pull Currency Opinion against Other Games" %}

It seems that only LAH players that have tried Another Eidos have some different patterns between the “less” and “more” group: in the “more generous” group, higher percentage of those from “more generous” group have abandoned Another Eidos than that of the “less generous” group (but we do not know if they are indeed using Another Eidos as the comparison).

(Tamacolle also shows a different pattern between the “less” and “more” group, but since the game does not require spending money to pull characters, I don’t think it really matters).

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/gacha-stone-spending.jpg"
  title="Free Gacha Pull Currency Opinion against Spending Level" %}

It is clear that even among players that have spent money in this game, we still have more of them feeling the game is less generous with free gacha pulls than other gacha games, this opinion is not just limited to those free-to-play players.

## Translation

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/translation.jpg"
  title="Translation Prediction" %}

Once again, we celebrate another game anniversary without official translation, which means 35.7% of the respondents made the correct prediction.

This number is much higher than last anniversary (27.2%), you can see that oversea players had lost faith in LifeWonders when they failed to fulfill their promise in last anniversary.

## Read story

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/read-story.svg"
  title="Do Live A Hero Player Read Story In-game?" %}

More than half of the respondents need to rely on fan translation (which are only available for some quests).

> I said from last year that I need to add the option of "Yes, I read the story in-game with the help of machine translation and some guesswork", but I forgot...

Comments:

- Muscular male furry characters once again dominated the popularity ranking, with {% chara_link Pubraseer %} being the top, while {% chara_link Barrel %} and {% chara_link Monomasa %} taking the second and third place with just one vote in difference.
- The gap between first place and second place is much more significant.
- {% chara_link Tsuneaki %} and {% chara_link Sterio %} are pretty high on the ranking too, perhaps due to recency biases as they are featured in the event when the survey was running.

As we move on to “top 10 favourites” popularity ranking, we can see that it often favours the older characters more. {% chara_link Tsuneaki %} and {% chara_link Sterio %}’s ranking somewhat dropped, while {% chara_link Gaius %} experienced the largest ranking boost this way.

- It seems that characters that gotten their variant forms between the time when 2023 and 2024 surveys were carried out (such as {% chara_link Polaris Mask %}, {% chara_link Lilac %}, {% chara_link Kalaski %} and {% chara_link Tsuneaki %}) have their ranking boosted quite significantly
  - This further suggests that the amount of character appearance in story and recency biases do play a role in their ranking.

{% chara_link Astar %}, {% chara_link Giansar %}, {% chara_link Yohack %}

  title="All Favourites vs Top 10 (Japan only)" %}

- The sample size is not large, but I think it is not wrong to speculate that Japan players are also mostly furry-lovers.
- {% chara_link Alchiba %} gets the biggest boost, jumping from 37th place to 12th place in "top 10" favourites ranking.

{% include figure-image.html path="/assets/img/survey-2024/fav-other.jpg"

  title="All Favourites vs Top 10 (Non-binary/Other respondents)" %}

The number of non-male respondents is small to begin with, so there are a lot of ties in votes.

{% chara_link Pubraseer %} is not the number 1 among these respondents, but still in the top 3. This character is just really well loved in all segment of the player base.

For female respondents, {% chara_link Sensettia %} is number 1 in “All favourites” ranking when they can choose as many characters as want, but {% chara_link Flamier %} overtake her by one vote in “top 10” ranking. {% chara_link Tsuneaki %} is number in "Top 10" ranking.

{% chara_link Barrel %} is only at 17th place in “All favourites” ranking, but shot up to 3rd place in "Top 10" among female respondents. This is quite aligned with what I observed in social media, where most Barrel fan arts are paired with the main character in the female human form.

{% chara_link reXer %}, {% chara_link Grigory %} also saw significant ranking boost in “Top 10” ranking.

In this gacha game that is full of baits for thirsty players, let us applaud these people who can limit the amount of characters they devote their hearts for.

{% chara_link Gaius %}, {% chara_link Canes %} and {% chara_link Player %} are ranked much higher by those who chose less than 10 favourites.

## New Illustrator Wishlist

People sure was not holding back when it comes to illustrator wishlist, we received tons of names for this question.

I did my absolute best to try finding the illustrator, but I wasn't able to fix all the typos, so I could only list the names I couldn't find verbatim.

Some of the suggestions are literally moonshot, so please do take a look at the list. To quote a joke from a friend: "some people dream so big, you can open a (Hero) Path".

## New Voice Actor Wishlist

Less respondents actually provide a wishlist for voice actors than for illustrators. Most admit that they do not know much about voice actor industry and just trust LifeWonders to make the call.

Despite that, we still receive a lot of names. Processing this question turned out to be quite challenging, because some people wrote voice actors' names as English (Hiragana), sometime even with accent symbols. Other people wrote in Kanji names. Furthermore, there were also several typos or alternative names. This made deduplication difficult.

Due to time constraint, I did not make a list of voice actors that respondents wished for but are actually already performed for this game. But I have to say, quite a few people ask for the voice actor for {% chara_link Theoreol %} (子安武人).

# Afterword

I hope you enjoy reading this report, because the whole process took me months to prepare. Many times the thought of “I should be paid for this work” flashed in my mind. It really is not easy to conduct a survey of this size, and then write a report about it!

For a lGbt game that we all know caters more towards gay players, I think LifeWonders’ success in attracting more players from other demographics is pretty commendable. If they can grow the group of paying players to keep the business running [while still staying true to their original mission](https://www.lifewonders.co.jp/?lang=en), I think that is good for everyone. (Ironically, "serving global market is also in their missions).

While waiting for the ever elusive release of official translation, this wiki will still be here supporting oversea players.

See you in next year survey!
