And then there are some countries who ban materials related to gay culture, so custom check is a problem.</p> <p>This is why I always advocate that <strong>we need digital format!</strong> You can focus on paying for the item itself instead of shipping cost, and don’t have to worry about national law and sanctions.</p> </blockquote> <p>Once again, in case LifeWonders think it is just F2P respondents spamming the question, here is another chart that only have <strong>Live A Hero players that spent in-game</strong>.</p> <figure> <img src="/assets/img/survey-2024/merchandise-difficulty-spending.jpg" width="1149" height="546" loading="lazy" alt="Difficulty in Buying Game Merchandise (players who spent in-game)" /> <figcaption>Difficulty in Buying Game Merchandise (players who spent in-game)</figcaption> </figure> <h2 id="extra-content">Extra Content</h2> <figure> <img src="/assets/img/survey-2024/extra-content.jpg" width="1111" height="546" loading="lazy" alt="Live A Hero Extra Content Wishlist" /> <figcaption>Live A Hero Extra Content Wishlist</figcaption> </figure> <p>Other comments in no particular order:</p> <ul> <li>Tons of comments about wanting anime/animation <ul> <li><span class="comment">Anime is very expensive…</span></li> </ul> </li> <li>Videos need english subtitle <ul> <li><span class="comment">Cannot agree more on this</span></li> </ul> </li> <li>Official livestream with game producers <ul> <li><span class="comment">Among games of similar genre, so far only Crave Saga has official livestream where the game producer showed his face <span class="masked">along with some Gogo boys</span>.</span></li> <li><span class="comment">I think LifeWonders can consider inviting a few official illustrators to join the livestream.

There was also one person from Japan who apparently is a contributor to the LAH JP Wiki. <span class="masked">Yeah, sometimes wikis just copy stuff from each other don’t we.</span></p> <p>And on to the other feedbacks and suggestions</p> <h3 id="character-profile-voice-line-not-translated">Character profile, voice line not translated</h3> <p>We used to have a few more contributors to work on translation, but now we are just down to one. We just need more contributors…</p> <h3 id="voicebgm-audio-files-spine-animation-on-wiki">Voice/BGM audio files, Spine animation on Wiki</h3> <p>Firstly, this Wiki is hosted on Github Pages with only 1GB free storage, so I don’t have a lot of leeway to work with. Secondly, LifeWonders don’t really like people sharing audio files widely (this is in their Terms of Service).</p> <p>If you know where to look, you can already find voice/BGMs in certain websites, but I cannot tell you where they are as the owner of this wiki.</p> <h3 id="skill-description-are-hard-to-read">Skill description are hard to read</h3> <p>Many people complain that the skill descriptions in Wiki are more wordy than the original Japanese game text, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[base skill] Deal 60% of damage to target enemy/100%</code> instead of just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Deal 60% damage to target enemy</code>.</p> <p>To explain that, here is a bit of history:</p> <ol> <li>The early contributors of this Wiki (myself included) were the same people that contributed to <a href="https://housamo.wiki">Housamo wiki</a> (and later the <a href="https://housamo-skill.netlify.app/">Housamo Skill DB</a>). We had the tradition of generating skill description by parsing game data and output description in a certain format to expose the most intricate details of the game mechanism</li> <li>That method worked well with Housamo even till today, the Wiki can auto generate most of the skill descriptions with minimal human intervention when game maintenance hasn’t even ended.</li> <li>However, LAH’s game mechanism evolved more wildly than Housamo. There were almost always new mechanisms added to LAH after every game maintenance.</li> <li>We began to see more and more crazy “system status counters”, “various types of skill triggers”, “one skill adding a new skill to another target”, “weird skill timing” and so on. Trying to maintain the algorithm to parse this kind of game data to generate human-readable descriptions becomes more and more infeasible.</li> <li>We obviously received a lot of complaints about the readability of the skill descriptions, and no good solution to fix, to the point where one day I just decided that some complicated skills will just be manually written by human contributors instead. However, we still wanted to keep most of the old machine-generated descriptions there, because at that time, we didn’t have that kind of manpower to rewrite those too manually (remember that all these works are unpaid).</li> </ol> <p>Around October this year, I made a bold decision to abandon the old system to generate skill descriptions automatically, and instead develop a new system to translate skill descriptions in a way that is more aligned with actual game UI. Fortunately, a few volunteers joined the effort, so now newer characters’ skills should have more readable descriptions, and the new system will be more prepared to welcome official translations when it happens.</p> <h3 id="list-of-xxx">List of XXX</h3> <p>I think many people didn’t know these pages exist:</p> <ul> <li><a href="/misc/">Misc lists</a></li> <li><a href="/statuses/">List of statuses that ever exist in game</a> <ul> <li>We might prepare something better for list of common buff/debuff in the future</li> </ul> </li> <li><a href="/items/">List of game items</a></li> </ul> <h3 id="there-should-be-a-way-to-jump-from-the-game-app-to-wiki-website">There should be a way to jump from the game app to Wiki website</h3> <p>… Do some people actually think that this Wiki is operating in an official way, and I am a LifeWonders’ employee?!</p> <h3 id="discord-role-where-we-get-notified-that-stocks-get-refilled">Discord role where we get notified that stocks get refilled</h3> <p>I think you should just follow the official X (Twitter) account</p> <h3 id="gameplay-tier-list-recommendation-and-strategy-guide-like-jp-wiki">Gameplay tier list, recommendation and strategy guide like JP Wiki</h3> <p>Since LAH JP Wiki kind of has it (like clarifying mechanism of certain unit, what hero/sidekick is good for this unit and why), I am not totally against having gameplay guide in this wiki. It is just that there are no volunteer who would write it.</p> <h3 id="filter-characters-by-buff--debuff">Filter characters by buff / debuff</h3> <p>We might implement such thing in the future for a few common buff/debuff statuses.</p> <h3 id="survey-question-suggestions">Survey question suggestions</h3> <ul> <li>Top 1 favourite question</li> <li>Favourite human / furry / female / costume / variant / event / artist / voice actors <ul> <li>New question for human / furry / female will require repeating that long list of characters in the survey. I am afraid that will increase the respondents’ fatigue. There are already people complaining that the list is too long to navigate in Google Form</li> <li>People may have very different standard when judging best costume / variant, most will ended up just choosing their favourite characters, so the questions become quite pointless</li> <li>Proof: <a href="https://x.com/BarrelCrankrack/status/1842968014620434859">X/Twitter Fashion Poll</a> <ul> <li><a href="/charas/sadayoshi/#s10811"><span class="item"><img src="/cdn/Sprite/icon_sadayoshi_s01.png" loading="lazy" width="32" height="32" /></span> Sadayoshi</a> is somehow top 5 fashionable characters, despite the fact that “not knowing much about being fashionable” is kind of coded into his personality (excluding his variant costume which was partly thanks to <a href="/charas/maculata/#s10591"><span class="item"><img src="/cdn/Sprite/icon_maculata_s01.png" loading="lazy" width="32" height="32" /></span> Maculata</a>’s design).</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Characters pairing <ul> <li>Right now I can’t think of how to set up this kind of question on Google Form since this is “one question that has two inputs”. I also cannot trust that everyone can spell names correctly. If I were to make it as one text input, enforcing text format and fixing typos would be a nightmare.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id="more-organized-list-of-fan-translations">More organized list of fan translations</h3> <p>We collect what we can on the wiki, but to be honest there really aren’t that many English fan translations for this game to begin with.</p> <ul> <li>For event/main quest translation, see <a href="https://housamosummaries.blogspot.com/">https://housamosummaries.blogspot.com/</a>.</li> <li>For event special quest fan translations, they are usually listed in the event info page.</li> <li>For character quest fan translations, see <a href="https://liveahero-wiki.github.io/chara_quests/">Character Quests</a></li> </ul> <h3 id="survey-needs-traditional-chinesespanish-translation">Survey needs Traditional Chinese/Spanish translation</h3> <p>Unfortunately that is just not practical. With just three languages (English, Simplified Chinese and Japanese), the survey already looks very cluttered, adding one more language will further impact the readability of the survey.</p> <h3 id="story-lore-section">Story lore section</h3> <p>Contribution welcomed. We also need the origin of character names.</p> <h3 id="comment-section-for-gameplay">Comment section for gameplay</h3> <p>I would suggest you to just ask help in LAH Discord (unofficial), there are many good players that give you better advice more quickly.</p> <h1 id="afterword">Afterword</h1> <p>I hope you enjoy reading this report, because the whole process took me months to prepare. Many times the thought of “I should be paid for this work” flashed in my mind. It really is not easy to conduct a survey of this size, and then write a report about it!</p> <p>For a lGbt game that we all know caters more towards gay players, I think LifeWonders’ success in attracting more players from other demographics is pretty commendable. If they can grow the group of paying players to keep the business running <a href="https://www.lifewonders.co.jp/?lang=en">while still staying true to their original mission</a>, I think that is good for everyone. (Ironically, “serving global market is also in their missions).</p> <p>While waiting for the ever elusive release of official translation, this wiki will still be here supporting oversea players.</p> <p>See you in next year survey!</p> <h2 id="data-sanitization">Data sanitization</h2> <p>I put this at the end because I know most people will find this boring, but given the sample size, it is not surprising that we might have responses that look suspicious. I will talk about some of the measures I took to sieve the responses.</p> <h3 id="suspicious-responses">Suspicious responses</h3> <ul> <li>A transgender girl from Antarctica, has JLPT N1 level but does not play the game, and requested an English translation for the game. <ul> <li>What is the probability that this combination actually exists in the world?? How many people were born in Antarctica, some more being a transgender? If you have achieved JLPT N1 level, you probably can play the game and read its story without English translation. This response was submitted after I had already added clarification on JLPT levels and other standardized Japanese language tests, the person clearly did not read the questions properly.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Someone who found the survey via “Atlantis”, born in the Philippines but claiming to be a Japanese native speaker, and the person’s “Top 10” and “All favourites” have no intersection <ul> <li>This response was also removed</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3 id="removing-duplicate-responses">Removing duplicate responses</h3> <p>Majority of the responses I had to remove fall under this category. Usually they are detected when I see the same set of comments/favourite selections appear in multiple responses.</p> <p>There might be even more duplicate responses, but eliminating them all is beyond my capability. I believe there are not that many duplicates to affect the overall result significantly.</p> <h3 id="people-just-dont-read-instructions">People just don’t read instructions!</h3> <p>For optional questions, please leave them blank if you have no comment, and I specifically said “don’t write N/A”, yet I still get some “N/A”, “No”, “None” and their equivalent in other languages for those questions.</p> <p>For the “when did you start playing Live A Hero” question, despite already stating that the game launched on 30 September 2020, there are still people who claim to have played the game before this date, some even as far back as the year 1998.</p> <p>And then we also have someone who claims to be 500 years old (maybe he was trying to type “50” instead).</p> </div> </article> </div> </main> <footer class="content__area"> <nav class="content"> <p>Content is available under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike</a> unless otherwise noted.
