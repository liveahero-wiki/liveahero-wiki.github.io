  BIO_H01: |-
    He is a survivor of the indigenous tribe of his native planet Muirauka IV, and
    the costume he wears as a hero is also that of his people's traditional best
    clothes.

    His parallel weapon, which takes the form of a course rope, can create an
    "ocean" filled with liquid-like energy in the space where the rope is released.

    As someone who lives together with the ocean, he can freely swim in that
    "ocean", toying with his opponent, and using water current for combat.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Hot-blooded, greedy and ruffian like, but his wish is purely to "Protect the
    Beautiful Ocean".

    The ocean in his homeland and his tribe was once nearly destroyed, due to the
    sudden influx of races from another planet and their development competition and
    exploitation.

    His grief and rebellion against the situation made his young mind fierce and
    drove him to become a pirate.

    That's why, he will never forgive anyone who pollute the ocean, the source of
    life, even if that ocean is in another planet.

  BIO_S01: |-
    A swimmer employed by the sporting goods company Phalanx.

    Long ago on the ocean planet Muilauka IV, he rampaged as a fearsome pirate
    villain, but after being captured and rehabilitated by heroes, he has become a
    pro swimmer and hero.

    As a former pirate, he has a bad temper and a lot of blood on his hands, but
    because he was a pirate, he has a strong sense of camaraderie and is very caring
    towards his allies.

    He is very susceptible to both flattery and provocation, so he can be easily
    manipulated at times.
