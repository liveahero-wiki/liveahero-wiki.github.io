{% capture BIO_H01 %}
He is a survivor of the indigenous tribe of his native planet Muirauka IV, and the costume he wears as a hero is also that of his people's traditional best clothes.

His parallel weapon, which takes the form of a course rope, can create an "ocean" filled with liquid-like energy in the space where the rope is released.

As someone who lives together with the ocean, he can freely swim in that "ocean", toying with his opponent, and using water current for combat.

{% capture BIO_H02 %}
Hot-blooded, greedy and ruffian like, but his wish is purely to "Protect the Beautiful Ocean".

The ocean in his homeland and his tribe was once nearly destroyed, due to the sudden influx of races from another planet and their development competition and exploitation.

His grief and rebellion against the situation made his young mind fierce and drove him to become a pirate.

That's why, he will never forgive anyone who pollute the ocean, the source of life, even if that ocean is in another planet.

{% capture BIO_S01 %}
A swimmer employed by the sporting goods company Phalanx.

Long ago on the ocean planet Muilauka IV, he rampaged as a fearsome pirate villain, but after being captured and rehabilitated by heroes, he has become a pro swimmer and hero.

As a former pirate, he has a bad temper and a lot of blood on his hands, but because he was a pirate, he has a strong sense of camaraderie and is very caring towards his allies.

He is very susceptible to both flattery and provocation, so he can be easily manipulated at times.
