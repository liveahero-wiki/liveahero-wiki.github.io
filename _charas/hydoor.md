  BIO_H01: |-
    He is a survivor of the indigenous tribe of his native planet Muirauka IV, and
    the costume he wears as a hero is also that of his people's traditional best
    clothes.

    His parallel weapon, which takes the form of a course rope, can create an
    "ocean" filled with liquid-like energy in the space where the rope is released.

    As someone who lives together with the ocean, he can freely swim in that
    "ocean", toying with his opponent, and using water current for combat.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Hot-blooded, greedy and ruffian like, but his wish is purely to "Protect the
    Beautiful Ocean".

    The ocean in his homeland and his tribe was once nearly destroyed, due to the
    sudden influx of races from another planet and their development competition and
    exploitation.

    His grief and rebellion against the situation made his young mind fierce and
    drove him to become a pirate.

    That's why, he will never forgive anyone who pollute the ocean, the source of
    life, even if that ocean is in another planet.

  BIO_H01: |-
    With some reservations, Hydoor found himself joining the "hero" party tasked with
    saving the world. Along the way, he took on the role as a warrior who charges ahead
    and leads the group. His appearance in this form strongly evokes his past life as
    a pirate. His parallel weapon, a pair of large cutlass-shaped blades, are similar
    to the ones that he expertly wielded in his past. With two gleaming blades in hand,
    he charges into the enemy lines, weaving through the battlefield and dodging
    attacks with such strength and finesse, that you would see his figure as if he
    was swimming gracefully in the ocean depths.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Born as a descendant of a dying race, Hydoor despised the defeatist atmosphere of
    his homeland and threw himself into the ocean. He could no longer bear the attitude
    of his people; they no longer considered a better tomorrow and instead spent the
    days wallowing in sorrow. Ironically, this new world he found himself in carried the
    same despondent air. That's why Hydoor chose to go against this world's supposed end
    and fight with all that he can for its survival. No matter how illogical or unsure
    it may seem, he's always been one to say that if ever he forgets to resist, then
    that's when it's actually over. The cutlasses he wields still shine with the same
    rebellious spirit he had when he was a pirate, the same spirit that could carve out
    even destiny itself.

  BIO_S01: |-
    A swimmer employed by the sporting goods company Phalanx.

    Long ago on the ocean planet Muilauka IV, he rampaged as a fearsome pirate
    villain, but after being captured and rehabilitated by heroes, he has become a
    pro swimmer and hero.

    As a former pirate, he has a bad temper and a lot of blood on his hands, but
    because he was a pirate, he has a strong sense of camaraderie and is very caring
    towards his allies.

    He is very susceptible to both flattery and provocation, so he can be easily
    manipulated at times.
