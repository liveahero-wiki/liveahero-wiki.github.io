Alchiba has the belief that "finding the truth in black and white" is most important, so he dyes even his jet-black wings white, transforming him into a detective hero.
His Parallel weapon, the monocle, has the ability to scan all the information hidden by the subject and visualize it as a record, and by reading, analyzing and inferring the record, the enemy's features and weaknesses, even the truth of the incident that is occurring can come to light.

He was a police officer in the national police, but he was falsely accused of uncovering the secrets that would reveal a large corruption.
Since then, he has been deeply distrustful of the police organization and has become obsessed with "black and white".
As long as there is a black-and-white incident in front of him, he will continue to be a detective and hero.

A winged alien who runs a detective bureau.

Because of his good-looking facial features and captivating narrow eyes, he's a self-proclaimed "nihilistic and cool" handsome detective. In reality, he's a flirty playboy who tries to seduce even his own clients, showing just how lecherous and greedy he is.

He tends to speak incessant bickering that could set anyone's teeth on edge. Nevertheless, he firmly follows his creed that "He will fulfill any requests recieved even if he dies in the process". This is because of his established reputation for laboral perfection, which has the detective industry thriving beyond expectation.
