  title: '"The Chaser" Alchiba'
occupation: Private Investigator

  BIO_H01: |-
    Alchiba has the belief that "finding the truth in black and white" is most
    important, so he dyes even his jet-black wings white, transforming him into a
    detective hero. His Parallel weapon, the monocle, has the ability to scan all
    the information hidden by the subject and visualize it as a record, and by
    reading, analyzing and inferring the record, the enemy's features and
    weaknesses, even the truth of the incident that is occurring can come to light.
  BIO_H02: |-
    He was a police officer in the national police, but he was falsely accused of
    uncovering the secrets that would reveal a large corruption. Since then, he has
    been deeply distrustful of the police organization and has become obsessed with
    "black and white". As long as there is a black-and-white incident in front of
    him, he will continue to be a detective and hero.

  BIO_H01: |-
    Alchiba gained the appearance of an "armed detective" who seeks to uncover the
    truth of the case with power as well as knowledge.

    He infers with calm and keen thoughts to counter the terrorist destruction of
    cultural heritage, and squeezes the trigger of his laser gun with righteous
    fury.

    The gun resembles what he had in his police days, striking him as bitterly
    ironic, noting the painfully familiar feeling as it fits perfectly in his hand.

    So, he will fly through the sandy dunes of Ten Teres with a new, highly mobile
    form.
  BIO_H02: |-
    In this new form, he wears black wings instead of white even after
    transformation.

    This is a symbol of his old self, the officer past he was never able to put
    behind him as  "the black wings that bring misery."

    Now that he has gained both wisdom and power, Alchiba looks back at the police
    organization that he turned away from years ago.

    His distrust hasn't been wiped out yet, but his feelings for the police are
    beginning to show signs of change.

  BIO_S01: |-
    A winged alien who runs a detective bureau.

    Because of his good-looking facial features and captivating narrow eyes, he's a
    self-proclaimed "nihilistic and cool" handsome detective. In reality, he's a
    flirty playboy who tries to seduce even his own clients, showing just how
    lecherous and greedy he is.

    He tends to speak incessant bickering that could set anyone's teeth on edge.
    Nevertheless, he firmly follows his creed that "He will fulfill any requests
    recieved even if he dies in the process". This is because of his established
    reputation for laboral perfection, which has the detective industry thriving
    beyond expectation.
