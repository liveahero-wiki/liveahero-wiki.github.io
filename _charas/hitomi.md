    Dressed in gorgeous and cute stage costumes, she stands dashingly on the
    battlefield and is active as an idol hero who calls herself "Doki doki Red".

    By transmitting her own singing voice through a microphone-type parallel weapon,
    she has the ability to give various effects to the surroundings, such as raising
    the fighting spirit of allies and neutralizing enemies.

    The idol-like behavior she has studied thoroughly catches the eyes of many
    spectators.
  BIO_H02: |-
    For her, a 15-year-old girl, she has a complex about her physical abilities.

    Despite being cute, she's struggling with her own abilities, which is the
    opposite of the idol profession that is praised by everyone.

    She continues to work hard every day to become a "perfect idol". Despite her
    delicate position of "it seems to sell but not well known", her hard-working
    appearance seems to heal and support the hearts of people who are chasing dreams
    but are frustrated without knowing it.

    Hitomi has acquired a new outfit suitable for her activities on the water planet
    Muirauka IV.

    Refusing to lose to the heat of summer, "I'm an idol warrior who fights
    according to TPO!".

    The floating speaker-shaped parallel weapons generate sound waves to fight
    enemies.

    As the "Doki Doki☆Red.Mermaid," Hitomi sings and fights with all her voice to
    restore peace to the resort for all the fans to enjoy.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Hitomi's attitude toward costumes is very enthusiastic, and she spends a lot of
    time choosing costumes that fit her concept for each of her singing activities
    and program broadcasts.

    It is only natural that Hitomi would be very interested in a hero transformation
    research in regards to hero costume.

    It may still be a long way to go to reach her goal of becoming a "perfect idol",
    but Hitomi feels that she is one step closer to realizing her dream.

    This summer's new song sung by Hitomi is now available at the music stores.

  BIO_S01: |-
    A half-Earthling and half-alien girl, located in Japan, Earth, to perform idol
    activities.

    Born in Hiroshima, Japan. Her stage name is Ayauta Hitomi.

    A traditional school idol who is lively, friendly, and always does her best.

    However, due to the genetic inheritance of her mother, an alien, she has
    acquired over-engineered physical capabilities for an Earthling.

    She often loses control of her abilities, so she's very prone to destroying
    equipment unintentionally.

    Because of this, she is especially afraid of situations in which she has to
    touch another person's body, such as handshake events.
