    He transforms into the white-clad hero "Doktor R". Possessing several parallel
    weapons in the form of surgical instruments such as scalpels and forceps, which
    he can use in combat and rescue activities. Due to his motto, "All lives that
    can be saved must be saved," his tools are designed to prevent him from killing
    even his enemies. As such, his heroic abilities shows its true value in "saving
    other people".
  BIO_H02: |-
    His Parallel Weapon's scalpel is designed to cut through the space between
    materials to create a tunnel inside the target, it does not damage the target it
    cuts through. Once stitched up, they are back to normal. The tools he holds in
    his hands while transforming will never hurt or kill others. This is his
    prerequisite and oath to continue being a hero. A restraint of sorts so that he
    remains the same even in the battlefield.

    A surgeon working at a general hospital in an immigrant city on the moon.

    An Asian Lunarian whose full name is Rakta Salya.

    As a doctor, he is an exceedingly serious person. Even though a fixed amount of
    trust in his abilities, his enthusiasm tends to run at idle because he is
    serious in everything he does.

    After being taught by a senior doctor that "Being a surgeon is a trial of
    strength", he has undergone various health methods and attend the gym 5 times a
    week, which is an aspect of a health nut who spares no effort even when
    misguided.
