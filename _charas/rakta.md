    He transforms into the white-clad hero "Doktor R". Possessing several parallel
    weapons in the form of surgical instruments such as scalpels and forceps, which
    he can use in combat and rescue activities. Due to his motto, "All lives that
    can be saved must be saved," his tools are designed to prevent him from killing
    even his enemies. As such, his heroic abilities shows its true value in "saving
    other people".
  BIO_H02: |-
    His Parallel Weapon's scalpel is designed to cut through the space between
    materials to create a tunnel inside the target, it does not damage the target it
    cuts through. Once stitched up, they are back to normal. The tools he holds in
    his hands while transforming will never hurt or kill others. This is his
    prerequisite and oath to continue being a hero. A restraint of sorts so that he
    remains the same even in the battlefield.

    Rakta went to visit a city famous as a summer retreat as a doctor.
    What he saw there were people who kept themselves healthy in bathhouses that healed the body while using the beautiful scenery around     them to heal their minds.
    He was so awestruck so much by this, that he vowed to become a doctor that will heal not only the body, but also the mind, which in       turn earned him a new hero form.
    The water jug in his hands is his parallel weapon which gushes forth water that can nurture the city's beautiful scenery.
    Those who touch the water feel more revitalized,
    while the flowers that bloom on the water's surafce soothe the minds of those who look at them. 
  BIO_H02: |-
    One of the patients that Rakta was in charge of during his residency was a person who could not get out of bed no matter how healthy      his body became.
    Regardless of the health of his body, his spirit was wracked with despair by the destruction of his home and the loss of everything       he had cared about.
    Rakta had always regretted not being able to bring hope back to the man.
    Swearing to accompany patients until they can stand up of their own volition and regain their mental and physical health,
    his parallel weapon's flowing water nurtured a landscape of trees and flowers,
    like the home that patient once loved. He is filled with renewed determination as a doctor.

    A surgeon working at a general hospital in an immigrant city on the moon.

    An Asian Lunarian whose full name is Rakta Salya.

    As a doctor, he is an exceedingly serious person. Even though a fixed amount of
    trust in his abilities, his enthusiasm tends to run at idle because he is
    serious in everything he does.

    After being taught by a senior doctor that "Being a surgeon is a trial of
    strength", he has undergone various health methods and attend the gym 5 times a
    week, which is an aspect of a health nut who spares no effort even when
    misguided.
