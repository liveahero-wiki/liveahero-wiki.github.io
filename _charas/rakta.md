His Parallel Weapon's scalpel is designed to cut through the space between materials to create a tunnel inside the target, it does not damage the target it cuts through.
Once stitched up, they are back to normal. The tools he holds in his hands while transforming will never hurt or kill others.
This is his prerequisite and oath to continue being a hero. A restraint of sorts so that he remains the same even in the battlefield.
