    It's said that in the old days, there exist exorcists in Japan.
    That form and power is a materialization of his strong wish.
    The paper talisman parallel weapon that he can summon, called shikifuda, transforms into various shikigami at his will and acts like a living creature. 
    It's a high performance power but with very bad fuel efficiency, 
    to compensate it subtitutes part of required viewpower energy with the power of yin-yang path of the flow of dragon veins.
    However, this coping method requires several conditions to be met, and his strength as a hero is easily influenced by his environment.
  BIO_H02: |-
    No information about him has been revealed, including whether he is a hero.
    The little bit of first-hand account described him to suddenly appear to settle an incident, 
    or sometimes appear to fight together with the heroes, only to leave right after.
    For some reason, there is no archived data of the hero live where he appeared , and no one has yet seen his personal life or pre-transformation appearance,
    making it difficult for even top journalists to uncover his true identity.

    **Additional information: Released by clearing the final episode of the event quest "Rakusai Travelouge".**

    <p><span class="masked">He is an Onmyoji Hero belonging to the Japan Self-Defense Authorities. He is in charge of handling cases that the bureau is not allowed to 
    act on as a public institution, such as undercover investigations into certain organizations. Therefore, only a few bureaucrats in the 
    Defense Bureau know the details of his affiliation and duties. The general public does not know that he is a hero, unless they are a total fanatic.
    Tsuneaki has taken over from his former mentor on Earth, and has acquired the knowledge and skills of an Onmyoji, even 
    though he is an alien. He willingly becomes a pawn of the government and lives in the shadow, dreaming that one day a world that 
    transcends the boundaries of race and position will be realized.</span></p>

  BIO_S01: |-
    Self-proclaimed local actor, born in Shinraku, a city in Kyoto created by alien immigrants.
    He likes to be involved with others and is a reasonably well-known face in his hometown.
    On the other hand, few people know about his personal life, and he himself is reluctant to talk about his private life.
    Since a certain incident, a way of speaking that avoid his true feelings has been deeply ingrained in him, 
    making it hard for him to actually convey himself to other people at crucial times.
    He loves the land and culture of Kyoto and therefore has mixed feelings about his origins.
