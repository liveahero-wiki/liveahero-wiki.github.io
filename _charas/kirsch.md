She transforms into a pâtissier hero with a large whisk-shaped parallel weapon that can be transformed into various confectionery tools.
The whisk has the ability to create vortices in the atmosphere, and with the "spinning confectionery technique" that she inherited from her master, she is able to sprinkle a wide variety of confectionery for her ally.
Her confections, created using her parallel weapon abilities, have the effect of restoring the exhaustion of both the heroes who ingest it and their parallel weapon.

She is unconventional in many respects, but her wish is also unconventional: to risk her life as a pâtissier to recreate the ultimate confection.
She will continue to be a fighting pâtissier until the day comes when she can recreate the "Legendary Sweets" that her master once met at the edge of the galaxy and wrote in his recipe after a near-death experience.
By the way, what makes her happiest is when people say that her sweets are delicious.

An alien girl who works as a pâtissier at a pastry shop in a certain town.

Known as "The Pâtissier Who Calls Upon the Storm", she makes sweets holding a hot blooded fighting spirit far unsuited for the role every day.

She took over the wishes of her teacher, who was eaten by a kaibutsu during his training to make the ultimate confection, using an unprecedented manufacturing method.

Claiming to be indifferent about anything unrelated to confectionery, both her words and her deeds are conspicuous and tend to contradict each other.
