## Notes

"I'm Kirsch, a pastry chef! I will keep on fighting until I can master the recipe of that fantastic sweet that made my teacher gasp in delight...!"

An alien girl who works as a pâtissier at a pastry shop in a certain town.

Known as "The Pâtissier Who Calls Upon the Storm", she makes sweets holding a hot blooded fighting spirit far unsuited for the role every day.

She took over the wishes of her teacher, who was eaten by a kaibutsu during his training to make the ultimate confection, using an unprecedented manufacturing method.

Claiming to be indifferent about anything unrelated to confectionery, both her words and her deeds are conspicuous and tend to contradict each other.
