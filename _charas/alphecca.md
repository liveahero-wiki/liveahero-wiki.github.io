    Unable to abandon his dream of becoming a knight, he transforms into a knightly
    hero wearing  shining white armor, wearing a mask that covers his face.

    On the battlefield, he wields a massive flaming sword as if the passion in his
    heart is being expressed, and he generously demonstrates his swordsmanship,
    which was once said to be the best in the country.

    It is unclear whether his performance stems from the frustration of not being
    able to become a knight due to his coronation, or from genuine desire to protect
    the people.
  BIO_H02: |-
    In his country, it was decided that the second son would take over the house
    after the eldest son died.

    As such, when his brother and father died, Alphecca was forced to take the
    throne.

    That doesn't mean that the flames that have been lit in his heart since
    childhood can be extinguished immediately.

    Alphecca continued to admire the knighthood and struggled to continue his days
    of training, even after his coronation.

    He summoned a confidant of his, an "observer" and proposed a concept....

    While travelling incognito to the beautiful capital of water,
    Alphecca heard the adventure story about the great king who cut open the path to the capital,
    that frontier spirit and how he's remembered by his people, excite him.
    
    The new form he got, very closely resembled that king.
    
    The trident shaped parallel weapon in his hand move freely with his intention,
    and is capable of making a path with the water it produced.
    
    The image of this Alphecca, is of a king who lead his army in the front, clearing the way for them.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Alphecca recalls the time he ascended the throne.
  
    After losing his father and brother in quick succession, he found himself leading a nation very suddenly.
  
    As a king and a knight, he has done his best to protect the country of Ardisia and the people who live there.
  
    But Alphecca had a hidden feeling in his heart.
  
    I want to not only protect what is here and now, but also make the country of Ardisia better and carve out a brighter future             together with my beloved people.
  
    With this wish in mind, the gentle king raises the "Spear of Reclamation" high.

  BIO_S01: |-
    The ruler of a kingdom from another planet called Aradicia, his full name being
    Alphecca Gemma the 21st.

    Although he had just recently inherited the throne, he was quite famous with the
    people and his soldiers due to his outstanding grace and dignity.

    However, due to the nature of his curious and free spirit, he oftentimes worries
    about the people close to him.

    Originally, because the second son doesn't inherit the throne, he trains to
    become a knight.

    It seems to have something to do with "The white knight" who appears on the
    battlefield gallantly and gets remarkable results.

    He invites the Rutilix, who has trouble achieving anything, to an exploration
    into a labyrinth which has quickly caused some turmoil.
