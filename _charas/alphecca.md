Unable to abandon his dream of becoming a knight, he transforms into a knightly hero wearing  shining white armor, wearing a mask that covers his face. 

On the battlefield, he wields a massive flaming sword as if the passion in his heart is being expressed, and he generously demonstrates his swordsmanship, which was once said to be the best in the country.  

It is unclear whether his performance stems from the frustration of not being able to become a knight due to his coronation, or from genuine desire to protect the people.

In his country, it was decided that the second son would take over the house after the eldest son died.

The ruler of a kingdom from another planet called Aradicia, his full name being Alphecca Gemma the 21st. 

Although he had just recently inherited the throne, he was quite famous with the people and his soldiers due to his outstanding grace and dignity. 

However, due to the nature of his curious and free spirit, he oftentimes worries about the people close to him. 

Originally, because the second son doesn't inherit the throne, he trains to become a knight.

It seems to have something to do with "The white knight" who appears on the battlefield gallantly and gets remarkable results.

He invites the Rutilix, who has trouble achieving anything, to an exploration into a labyrinth which has quickly caused some turmoil.
