    Unable to abandon his dream of becoming a knight, he transforms into a knightly
    hero wearing  shining white armor, wearing a mask that covers his face.

    On the battlefield, he wields a massive flaming sword as if the passion in his
    heart is being expressed, and he generously demonstrates his swordsmanship,
    which was once said to be the best in the country.

    It is unclear whether his performance stems from the frustration of not being
    able to become a knight due to his coronation, or from genuine desire to protect
    the people.

    In his country, it was decided that the second son would take over the house
    after the eldest son died.

    As such, when his brother and father died, Alphecca was forced to take the
    throne.

    That doesn't mean that the flames that have been lit in his heart since
    childhood can be extinguished immediately.

    Alphecca continued to admire the knighthood and struggled to continue his days

    The ruler of a kingdom from another planet called Aradicia, his full name being
    Alphecca Gemma the 21st.

    Although he had just recently inherited the throne, he was quite famous with the
    people and his soldiers due to his outstanding grace and dignity.

    However, due to the nature of his curious and free spirit, he oftentimes worries
    about the people close to him.

    Originally, because the second son doesn't inherit the throne, he trains to
    become a knight.

    It seems to have something to do with "The white knight" who appears on the
    battlefield gallantly and gets remarkable results.

    He invites the Rutilix, who has trouble achieving anything, to an exploration
    into a labyrinth which has quickly caused some turmoil.
