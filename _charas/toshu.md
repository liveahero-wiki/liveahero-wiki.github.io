In honor of a man he once met when he landed on Earth, a samurai he acknowledges as "the noblest spirit on Earth", he transforms into a hero who mimics the appearance of a samurai on the battlefield.
His weapon is a sword with a blade made up of an energy, and he attacks his opponents by slashing at them in one fell swoop, a style of fighting that is unique to his hot-blooded nature.
His "offensive" approach has the weakness in that his "defense" becomes thin.

"To catch up with the true samurai he met that day" is his goal and his belief in the path of the sword.
He once studied under a samurai who called himself "Sakimori" and learned the way of the sword on this planet.
The man's way of life, whose whereabout is unknown, is the ultimate ideal and his goal.
He will continue to wield his sword on the battlefield until the day he can recognize himself as "a true samurai".

A Kendo artist who is a teacher at Hinowa University of Physical Education, serving as an advisor to the institution's kendo club

He is an extraordinary disciplined and rigid warrior, raised in a strict family that has served as knights for generation in his alien hometown.

Although he partakes in spiritual training, he has a short temper and is quite hotheaded, so if you touch his mane, there's a high chance that he will snap.

Because of his personality, which can only be considered as strait-laced, he can't quite express honest feelings of happiness or fondness.

Dare someone tease him and call him a "tsundere" he WILL snap.
