{% capture BIO_H01 %}
In honor of a man he once met when he landed on Earth, a samurai he acknowledges as "the noblest spirit on Earth", he transforms into a hero who mimics the appearance of a samurai on the battlefield.
His weapon is a sword with a blade made up of an energy, and he attacks his opponents by slashing at them in one fell swoop, a style of fighting that is unique to his hot-blooded nature.
His "offensive" approach has the weakness in that his "defense" becomes thin.

"To catch up with the true samurai he met that day" is his goal and his belief in the path of the sword.
He once studied under a samurai who called himself "Sakimori" and learned the way of the sword on this planet.
The man's way of life, whose whereabout is unknown, is the ultimate ideal and his goal.
He will continue to wield his sword on the battlefield until the day he can recognize himself as "a true samurai".

During battles in the newfound space, Toshu fought against mysterious enemies and realized his own weaknesses. 

He faced those weaknesses with rigorous training, and in result of that, obtained a new form. 

With a calm mind as clear as water, he sharpens his spirit, feels the environment on his skin and follows the path his sword need to take to claim victory. 

The reason for that, is because he wanted to win against his passionate emotions, as well as to guide his allies to victory. 

It is a strategy used in order to embody his "samurai" way of doing things.

He is a stoic man who has trained himself to overcome his various weaknesses, but there are things he could not overcome no matter how hard he tried.

One of it is water. Unable to swim and having a fear of water, he is extremely afraid of fighting around any body of water.

It is never easy to overcome a deep-rooted sense of weakness. However, he can never move forward by avoiding it.

His choice in this, is not to conquer the water, but to temper himself so that he can have inner calm even in the presence of water.

{% capture BIO_S01 %}
A Kendo artist who is a teacher at Hinowa University of Physical Education, serving as an advisor to the institution's kendo club

He is an extraordinary disciplined and rigid warrior, raised in a strict family that has served as knights for generation in his alien hometown.

Although he partakes in spiritual training, he has a short temper and is quite hotheaded, so if you touch his mane, there's a high chance that he will snap.

Because of his personality, which can only be considered as strait-laced, he can't quite express honest feelings of happiness or fondness.

Dare someone tease him and call him a "tsundere" he WILL snap.
