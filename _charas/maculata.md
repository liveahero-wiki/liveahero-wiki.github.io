    For her, "to attack" means "to fight," "to resist," and "to be yourself".

    makes them dance with her.

    To take control and lead things to where she wants is her way of doing things.

    rebellion by her against those adults, as she herself became an adult, she
    changes to hold the identity of "I am who I am" as her most important
    principles.

  BIO_S01: |-
    An alien woman who has an office in Orient City and is active as a fashion
    designer.

    Self-proclaimed "carnivorous woman",  with a bullish and courageous personality,
    there is always a spirit of not letting anyone else take charge.

    Taking advantage of her natural beauty and blessed body, she can be a model that
    stands on the runway herself.

    Because of her strict attitude toward herself and others, she has a slight
    temper.

    Although she is a master to Sui, the sense of distance from her best friend's
    daughter is a little delicate because of the circumstances.
