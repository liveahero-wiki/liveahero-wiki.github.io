Their species tends to prefer clothes that are easy to move in and lightweight tools and weapons in order to take advantage of their innate high physical abilities. This can be seen in their clothes and weapons after their transformation. Also, in exchange for having well-developed ears and nose, their eyes are sensitive to strong sunlight, as such many of them prefers to use visual aid such as sunglasses or eye scope. It may seems like their species wear sunglasses for style, but there is actually some serious reason for it.

An alien youth with a wolf-like appearance, one of the species that more commonly migrates to Earth.
They are often seen as a species of rough people because all the young people who are enthusiastic and rowdy are the most likely to wander from their homeworld, but like Earthlings, each individual has different personalities, tastes, and dreams. Looking only at those who are active as villains, there are of course some who are proud of being villains and others who have a faint admiration for heroes.
