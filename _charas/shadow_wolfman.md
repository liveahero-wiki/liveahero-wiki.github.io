    Their species tends to prefer clothes that are easy to move in and lightweight
    tools and weapons in order to take advantage of their innate high physical
    abilities. This can be seen in their clothes and weapons after their
    transformation. Also, in exchange for having well-developed ears and nose, their
    eyes are sensitive to strong sunlight, as such many of them prefers to use
    visual aid such as sunglasses or eye scope. It may seems like their species wear
    sunglasses for style, but there is actually some serious reason for it.

    An alien youth with a wolf-like appearance, one of the species that more
    commonly migrates to Earth. They are often seen as a species of rough people
    because all the young people who are enthusiastic and rowdy are the most likely
    to wander from their homeworld, but like Earthlings, each individual has
    different personalities, tastes, and dreams. Looking only at those who are
    active as villains, there are of course some who are proud of being villains and
    others who have a faint admiration for heroes.
