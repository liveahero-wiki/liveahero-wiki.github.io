  BIO_H01: |-
    Akashi transforms into a hero who fights with a mass of powerful flames and a
    bat.

    The ball of fire is created from 2 rings attached to both his arms, and by using
    his own energy as a resource, he is able to throw the ball at incredible speeds
    much like a slugger.
  BIO_H02: |-
    There was once a time when he got eaten by a Kaibutsu and he realised something
    important.

    During that time, he found out that things eaten by Kaibutsu not only die, but
    they are removed from everyone's memories.

    Everyone dies eventually, but those eaten by Kaibutsu aren't even allowed to be
    remembered.

    "Is there a way for me to leave some living proof...." Even today, he clasps his
    bat and that idea looms over his thoughts.

  BIO_H01: |-
    A new form of Akashi dressed in an amphibious hero suit.

    He has gained a lot of experience as a hero, and is slowly beginning to look
    like a full-fledged hero.

    He attacks by creating energy bullets from his baseball glove parallel weapon,
    The pitching form that fires from the powerful shoulders he honed as an
    outfielder is as quick as any fastball.

    In order to recapture the hijacked resort ship, Akashi confronts the pirate
    villains in a new form.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Developed by Hisaki's research team, the hero suit allow a certain degree of
    directional transformation, in this new transformation the suit shows its true
    value in places with a lot of water such as Muirauka IV.

    By deploying a bubble-shaped shield with the mechanical units floating around,
    it is possible to battle underwater even for a human.

    Akashi seems to be concerned about the degree of exposure of his new appearance,
    but Maculata, who was in charge of the design, seems to be satisfied with it.
    "The design has been completed to maximize his charm!".

    Akashi is born and raised in Orient City, a native Earthling. Full name's
    Tamamura Akashi.

    He is a childhood friend of the protagonist in this universe. Despite not

    justice.

    He is a university student who attends the Hinowa University of Physical
    Education and Sports, a member of the baseball club and a part-timer. Although
    his batting average in practice games is at a professional level, he tends to be
    weak in tense situations and is unable to fully demonstrate his abilities in
    public.

## Notes

- His full name is Tamamura Akashi (<ruby>魂群<rt>たまむら</rt></ruby>アカシ).
- In LifeWonders' previous game "Tokyo Afterschool Summoners", there is another character called [Tamamura Gunzo](https://housamo.wiki/Gunzo) (<ruby>魂群<rt>たまむら</rt></ruby>グンゾウ).
  Not only do they share the same surname, they are also drawn by the same artist and voiced by the same voice actor ~~and have the same iconic "smile with eye pupil" expression~~. It seems like the similarity is intentional, but the relationship between Akashi and Gunzo is currently unknown.
- Akashi currently studies in Hinowa Physical Education University (ヒノワ体育大学). In the gay games called "Wrestle Fight" and "Rental Athletes" released by LifeWonders' previous doujin circle "四畳半的生活", there was also a university with the same name (written in Japanese as <ruby>日輪<rt>ひのわ</rt></ruby>体育大学).
