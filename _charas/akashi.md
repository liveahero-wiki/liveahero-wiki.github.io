Akashi transforms into a hero who fights with a mass of powerful flames and a bat. The ball of fire is created from 2 rings attached to both his arms, and by using his own energy as a resource, he is able to throw the ball at incredible speeds much like a slugger.

There was once a time when he got eaten by a Kaibutsu and he realised something important. During that time, he found out that things eaten by Kaibutsu not only die, but they are removed from everyone's memories. Everyone dies eventually, but those eaten by Kaibutsu aren't even allowed to be remembered. "Is there a way for me to leave some living proof...." Even today, he clasps his bat and that idea looms over his thoughts.

A new form of Akashi dressed in an amphibious hero suit.
He has gained a lot of experience as a hero, and is slowly beginning to look like a full-fledged hero.
He attacks by creating energy bullets from his baseball glove parallel weapon, 
The pitching form that fires from the powerful shoulders he honed as an outfielder is as quick as any fastball.
In order to recapture the hijacked resort ship, Akashi confronts the pirate villains in a new form.

## Notes

- His full name is Tamamura Akashi (<ruby>魂群<rt>たまむら</rt></ruby>アカシ).
- In LifeWonders' previous game "Tokyo Afterschool Summoners", there is another character called [Tamamura Gunzo](https://housamo.wiki/Gunzo) (<ruby>魂群<rt>たまむら</rt></ruby>グンゾウ).
  Not only do they share the same surname, they are also drawn by the same artist and voiced by the same voice actor ~~and have the same iconic "smile with eye pupil" expression~~. It seems like the similarity is intentional, but the relationship between Akashi and Gunzo is currently unknown.
- Akashi currently studies in Hinowa Physical Education University (ヒノワ体育大学). In the gay games called "Wrestle Fight" and "Rental Athletes" released by LifeWonders' previous doujin circle "四畳半的生活", there was also a university with the same name (written in Japanese as <ruby>日輪<rt>ひのわ</rt></ruby>体育大学).
