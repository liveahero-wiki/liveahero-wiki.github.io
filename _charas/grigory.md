    It can capture, film, and distribute the footage of heroes, and do whatever is necessary for LIVE.

  BIO_H02: |-
    His underlying principle as a hero is that he can't stand the situation where heroes can't fully demonstrate their abilities.
  
    In his childhood, he saw news about missing heroes.
  
    Seeing that, he thought, Those heroes might have been overrun without being able to transform, it made him feel great fear and resentment.
  
    It is not clear when he awakened to his heroic abilities, but the parallel weapon he possesses 
    is the embodiment of the dream he had on the day of the incident: "I will fly to any place, and no hero will be left alone."
