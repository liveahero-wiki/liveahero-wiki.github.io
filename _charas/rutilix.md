    Growing up while watching the back of his father, who is a fine knight, he
    transform into a hero with a fine mane, a cloak at his back, and a set of
    dignified armor just like his father.

    Armed with a rapier made from light as a weapon, and a well-tempered body, even
    when wearing heavy armor, he dash around the battlefield in high speed.

    There is not much difference in his swordmanship before transformation, but his
    blow, filled with his passion, sometimes bring forth miraculous result.
  BIO_H02: |-
    In a country with an antiquated tradition where the eldest child is the one who
    will succeed the house, no matter how much a youngest child like him wishes to
    have an achievement to his name, society will not aid him in that.

    With no connection to use, and no one to teach him swordmanship, he who always
    put his effort in solitude, is compelled to aim high.

    Even with his situation, he keep his spirit and continue to aim to be a knight,
    what drives this is an immature dream of  "I want to be a fine knight that can
    protect the country and the people".

  BIO_S01: |-
    A knight apprentice who is part of the cavalry belonging to a kingdom from
    another world, named Aradisia.

    He intends to become a fine knight, and he has a great deal of enthusiasm, but
    he has a short temper and is impatient.

    His sword skill is named Henachoco and it has many drawbacks. He is the youngest
    child of a low-class family, and therefore he gets neglected often in the squad
    he is in. On top of that, he is impatient because he is not able to amass any
    achievements.

    Even so, he is quite liked by King Alphecca due to his dedication to his knight
    training.  Because he and Akashi have such similar personalities, they tend to
    often get into arguments.

    After accepting King Alphecca's invitation, he went out on a journey into a
    labyrinth that is rumored to be difficult to escape.
