  BIO_H01: |-
    The one who values the public transportation facility's safety above all else
    transforms into a mecha hero called "Transaver". He was originally developed to
    have an emotional 'living' side and a 'hero' side which can transform in order
    to defeat all kaibutsu and obstacles in his way. His weapon of choice is a
    railgun which uses very high firepower in order to eliminate its target.
  BIO_H02: |-
    There was a day when the war ended and the public transportation of the ferry
    resumed. The brave figure of the train going through the air was just a "symbol
    of peace" for him. Therefore, it is a very precious thing for him that public
    transportation is operating on time, and it is an event that must be protected.
    He takes decisive action against those who try to disturb that symbol of peace.

  BIO_S01: |-
    A living humanoid robot originating from the planet of machine life-forms,
    Tronesion.

    He takes the position of a train conductor and driver of a company known as "The
    Galactic Railroad". From regional railroads to interplanetary routes; the
    company has a vast amount of transportation lines for passengers.

    Being remarkably serene and earnest, he is very obedient to the rules and
    especially strict when it comes to time. Even mere seconds of tardiness are not
    tolerated.

    Although his personality is more mechanical than that of the average robot, he
    is capable of showing emotions since he is a life-form who was born with them.

    If he is given affection, he will meekly return the favor.
