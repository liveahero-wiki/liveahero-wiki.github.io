    Procy transforms into an unusual hero specializing in making money, born from
    his strong desire to become a millionaire. The hammer he wields is part of a
    parallel weapon set, along with a tiny robot that flies around nearby. The robot
    tells Procy the most profitable course of action at any given moment, and gives
    Procy a chance to make a fortune with a hammer that transforms its shape to be
    more suitable for any given situation.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Born and raised in a poverty-stricken environment in which having a tomorrow was
    never guaranteed, he lived as a hard laborer in a mine, all while dreaming of
    becoming a millionaire who could live comfortably. At that time, when the
    Kaibutsu attacked, the mallet he was carrying changed to a small parallel
    weapon, and his life changed completely. Realizing he could leverage his power
    as hero to make a fortune, he bets it all on one big gamble to change his life
    for the better.

  BIO_H01: |-
    Procy took the form as a hero and a reliable bancho with steel resolution.<br>
    His willingness to face head-on the thoughts and feelings of someone he had overlooked because of his lack of honesty is reflected in his hero suit, 
    which resembles a school uniform.<br>
    He dreamed of becoming a wealthy billionaire when he was a poor student. While he has yet to achieve it, Procy has started to look beyond it.<br>
    With his fist trained while having scuffles with his rowdy friends, he now takes the lead and uses this strength to protect his friends.<br>
  BIO_H02: |-
    One day, Procy decided to leave the slums, and determined to embark on a journey to earn money.<br>
    There he found a boy waiting for him, he gave him a muffler, as a thanks for saving his life.<br>
    With what kind of feelings did the boy give that tattered muffler to him…
    right now he kind of understand the thoughts inside the heroes who never ask anything in return.<br>
    With the scarf he didn't receive that day fluttering around his neck, Procy rushes to his friends faster than anyone else, his fists ready.

  BIO_S01: |-
    An alien who runs "The Guild of Heroes : Earth Camp", and information exchange
    center and bar for heroes.

    Located near the company where the protagonist works at. Despite looking like a
    cute little puppy, he's a veteran hero with more than 20 years of career over
    his shoulder. He is old friends with Ryekie and Huckle.

    Although he is caring and open hearted man, his attachment to money is stronger
    than anything. Ever.

    He hates excessive payments and very much prefers get-rich-quick schemes one way
    or another.

    It seems like the bar's opening cost has him up to his neck in debt.
