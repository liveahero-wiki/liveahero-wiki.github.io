    Procy transforms into an unusual hero specializing in making money, born from
    his strong desire to become a millionaire. The hammer he wields is part of a
    parallel weapon set, along with a tiny robot that flies around nearby. The robot
    tells Procy the most profitable course of action at any given moment, and gives
    Procy a chance to make a fortune with a hammer that transforms its shape to be
    more suitable for any given situation.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Born and raised in a poverty-stricken environment in which having a tomorrow was
    never guaranteed, he lived as a hard laborer in a mine, all while dreaming of
    becoming a millionaire who could live comfortably. At that time, when the
    Kaibutsu attacked, the mallet he was carrying changed to a small parallel
    weapon, and his life changed completely. Realizing he could leverage his power
    as hero to make a fortune, he bets it all on one big gamble to change his life
    for the better.

  BIO_S01: |-
    An alien who runs "The Guild of Heroes : Earth Camp", and information exchange
    center and bar for heroes.

    Located near the company where the protagonist works at. Despite looking like a
    cute little puppy, he's a veteran hero with more than 20 years of career over
    his shoulder. He is old friends with Ryekie and Huckle.

    Although he is caring and open hearted man, his attachment to money is stronger
    than anything. Ever.

    He hates excessive payments and very much prefers get-rich-quick schemes one way
    or another.

    It seems like the bar's opening cost has him up to his neck in debt.
