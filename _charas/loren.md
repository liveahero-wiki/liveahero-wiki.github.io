    his hand and in gratitude told him "you're like an angel",so he decided to
    become a nurse.

    in White".

    continue to flap his wings to save lives.

    A Nurse Working at a general hospital in the lunar capital.

    An earthling from Birmingham, England. His Full name is Loren Farrand

    Because of his gentle and soft personality, he is popular within patients, but
    because his clumsiness often lead him to question "why does this always happen
    to me?", he is an oopsie nursie.

    Despite this, he can also be useful in the hospital, since he is the only one
    who can restrain the rampaging doctor, Rakta, who plays an active role as a
    similar hero.
