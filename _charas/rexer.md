    Transforming into a hero with a bright colored visor and armor, his parallel
    weapon is a huge sword that can also transform into a battle axe.

    His fighting style, in which he transforms freely according to the battle
    situation and the opponent to then rounds up all his enemies, is exactly like
    that of a hunter who stands up against a huge monster in a video game world.

    However, at some point, there has been a change in his fighting style, and fans
    are concerned about what happened.
  BIO_H02: |-
    The reXer that exist now, is a different entity than the reXer in the past.

    His true identity, is the former reXer's real son.

    He inherits this avatar from his father, who goes missing when fighting against
    a kaibutsu in real life, and he continues to use the name reXer.

    Oddly enough, he also has the talent for games, although he is able to work as a
    professional gamer, he did not inherit his heroic activities.

    He has only one wish. To bring back to the world the hero reXer that his father
    raised.

    reXer is a pro gamer with an unknown age belonging to the Neotalents
    Production's pro gamer team "μ-Hyperions".

    Besides just working as a professional gamer, he also works as a cyber hero TV
    personality in the virtual space.

    He is top ranked in every gaming field in terms of skill, and while he does give
    off the vibe of a mature man who possesses a calm way of speaking, he is very
    childish on the inside.

    He used to work as a hero in the real world, but nowadays he seems to have
    disappeared.
