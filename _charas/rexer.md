    Though he was once active as a hero in the real world, rieker is now a "Cyber
    Hero", primarily operating in virtual space, with overwhelming feats surpassing
    any other hero, light, swift steps like that in a video game, along with his
    fighting style, switching his Parallel Weapon's form between a great-sword and
    a battle-axe, are objects of admiration for young people.

    Surely, you must have seen schoolchildren imitating him, grabbing tree
    branches and shouting, "Oversynchro Execution!" at least once?

    reXer is said to train diligently every day in order to surpass, "the hero he
    aims to be". Keep a close eye on his rapid advancement as he continues to
    expand his field of activity beyond the online world.

    Shooting games, fighting games, puzzle games, rhythm games...

    In every genre, they monopolize the top ranks: the highly skilled
    pro-gaming team, "μ-Hypertions" (mu-Hyperions).

    On this team managed by Neo-Talents Production, the real faces
    hidden behind the members' avatars are, unfortunately, no-mo for
    public disclosure.

    However, in the game play-through videos that he personally
    streams, you can catch glimpses of his preferences and his hidden
    side during his commentary.

    He has pulled out numerous streams, but among them, his personal
    recommendation is his "Can't Leave This Room Until I Completely
    Clear It!" series.

    On stages with no exit, swimming with all kinds of monsters, his
    performance as he screams while leap-frogging through his foes like a
    breeze in a must-see, even for those unfamiliar with video games.

    If you want to know more, you should subscribe to his channel.

    Transforming into a hero with a bright colored visor and armor, his parallel
    weapon is a huge sword that can also transform into a battle axe.

    His fighting style, in which he transforms freely according to the battle
    situation and the opponent to then rounds up all his enemies, is exactly like
    that of a hunter who stands up against a huge monster in a video game world.

    However, at some point, there has been a change in his fighting style, and fans
    are concerned about what happened.
  BIO_H02: |-
    The reXer that exist now, is a different entity than the reXer in the past.

    His true identity, is the former reXer's real son.

    He inherits this avatar from his father, who goes missing when fighting against
    a kaibutsu in real life, and he continues to use the name reXer.

    Oddly enough, he also has the talent for games, although he is able to work as a
    professional gamer, he did not inherit his heroic activities.

    He has only one wish. To bring back to the world the hero reXer that his father
    raised.

    reXer is a pro gamer with an unknown age belonging to the Neotalents
    Production's pro gamer team "μ-Hyperions".

    Besides just working as a professional gamer, he also works as a cyber hero TV
    personality in the virtual space.

    He is top ranked in every gaming field in terms of skill, and while he does give
    off the vibe of a mature man who possesses a calm way of speaking, he is very
    childish on the inside.

    He used to work as a hero in the real world, but nowadays he seems to have
    disappeared.
