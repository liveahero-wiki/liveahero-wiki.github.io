    Lilac's pruning shears-shaped parallel weapon can be manipulated without being
    touched by his will alone, and he attacks by sending them flying after
    opponents.

    The size and number of shears can be adjusted according to the ViewPower
    consumed, but it takes a considerable amount of physical and mental strength to
    manipulate several of them at the same time.

    However, the sharpness of the shears is outstanding, and as long as the object
    is perceived by Lilac as a branch or leaf, it can cut off both sides of any
    object, no matter how hard it is.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Lilac's older brother, Hashidoi was born sickly from birth, with particularly
    poor eyesight and a fondness for flowers and other fragrant things.

    Contrary to his brother, Lilac as a child was active and dynamic, but when
    Hashidoi became ill and was unable to play with him for days at a time, he would
    lash out in childish anger and say things he didn't mean.

    Although he felt deep remorse even as a child, Lilac permanently lost the
    opportunity to apologize for it one day, and came to be grounded in the idea
    that what one wants to say should be said right away rather than put off.

  BIO_S01: |-
    A young man born and raised in Wemalt, a peaceful city in a temperate alien
    region.

    Outwardly, he seems to be no different from the earthling, but he is an alien.

    His sharp glare tend to frighten others, which he is self concious about, so he
    hides his face beneath his hair often He has a soft and gentle personality.

    Influenced by his brother Hashidoi in his childhood, he became interested in
    plants and flowers.

    He believes that flowers, which are often used as gifts to convey feelings, have
    the power to convey some sentiments better than words.
