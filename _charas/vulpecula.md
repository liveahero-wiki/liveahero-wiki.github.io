    Vulpecula's parallel weapon is the altered pocket watch he wears on a daily
    basis, it can affect time itself, both for himself and his surroundings.

    While slowing down the current time dilation, Vulpecula himself can move freely,
    so he moves and attacks at sub-speed as if he disappeared.

    While powerful, depending on the area of influence, it also places a heavy
    burden on himself.

    It is also incompatible against an ability that stop time or one that limit his
    range of action, so this ability is kept as a secret.

    He hope for a world where everyone looks at the present and lives in the moment
    without looking back at the past.

    This was the form of wish that Vulpecula had arrived at. In order to free
    himself from the sorrow that steals and binds him to the past, he raised a
    prayer that resembled an obsession.

    Vulpecula hides his true face behind a mask and travels throughout the universe
    to make the sorrowful forget their suffering and to live life to the fullest in
    the present.

    He says he has left the past behind, but his dreams are supported by the past
    itself, he hold within himself a huge contradiction.

    A phantom thief by the name of Vulpecula who is known to steal valuable cultural
    properties and destroy places of cultural heritage.

    He describes these acts as "stealing the landscape", and before the crime, a
    mysterious and poetic notice video is always distributed on illegal sites.

    Some people sympathize with his ideals and he has attained a level of cult
    popularity, and enthusiastic fans often become his subordinate villains.

    He always wears a fox mask and no one knows his true face, but because of that
    many copycats have appeared and begun to disturb society.
