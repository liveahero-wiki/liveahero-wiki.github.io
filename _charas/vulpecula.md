Vulpecula's parallel weapon is the altered pocket watch he wears on a daily basis, it can affect time itself, both for himself and his surroundings.

While slowing down the current time dilation, Vulpecula himself can move freely, so he moves and attacks at sub-speed as if he disappeared.

While powerful, depending on the area of influence, it also places a heavy burden on himself.

It is also incompatible against an ability that stop time or one that limit his range of action, so this ability is kept as a secret.

He hope for a world where everyone looks at the present and lives in the moment without looking back at the past.

This was the form of wish that Vulpecula had arrived at. In order to free himself from the sorrow that steals and binds him to the past, he raised a prayer that resembled an obsession.

Vulpecula hides his true face behind a mask and travels throughout the universe to make the sorrowful forget their suffering and to live life to the fullest in the present.

He says he has left the past behind, but his dreams are supported by the past itself, he hold within himself a huge contradiction.
