    In the battlefield Kiloc transform into a military-style hero suit resembling that of a captain.

    The anchor-shaped parallel weapon slung over his shoulder can also be used as a throwing weapon,
    but that is not its primary purpose.
  
    The anchor, when fired towards the destination the ship should reach,
    paradoxically serves the purpose of keeping the ship nearby.
    This means that when the anchor reaches its target, a barrier is deployed around the ship to safely guide the crew.
    
    However, the anchor’s true effectiveness cannot be realized if it is shot down,
    and this flaw is intertwined with its nature.
    Therefore, proper situational judgment is essential for its use
  BIO_H02: |-
    Kiloc, the son of the former supreme fleet commander of Estevolta, was subjected to an elite education from a young age
    to learn how to operate the urban fleet.
  
    However, despite his father being a strict and hardworking person, Kiloc developed a sense of resentment
    towards him for neglecting his family.
  
    As a result, Kiloc grew into a person who was far removed from the ideal son his father had envisioned.
    He was a carefree, cheerful, and outgoing person who hardly worked, and though the people of Estevolta would tease him as the
    playboy, reckless son, they couldn’t help but find him likable.

    When he eventually became the captain, the hero he presented himself to be, aim to lead everyone to a peaceful,
    calm sea without conflict, was far removed from his usual demeanor.

    However, only a select few knew the true thoughts behind his actions.

    A man who holds the position of Supreme Fleet Commander, the highest-ranking officer overseeing all the ships of Estevolta,
    the largest urban fleet in the Muirauqa IV.

    True to his nickname as the most carefree person in Muirauqa, he is an uninhibited, easygoing individual who is lazy,
    flirtatious, and highly lecherous.

    He engages in daily interactions with his adopted son, Joezen, who serves as the fleet's navigator,
    to the point where it is unclear who is the guardian and who is the dependent.

    The background behind this man’s appointment as the commander of Estevolta is rumored to involve the
    covert actions of the governing organization of Muirauqa IV, the Council of Commanders,
    though this remains nothing more than speculation.
