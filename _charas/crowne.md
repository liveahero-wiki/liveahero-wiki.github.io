    Crowne fights using her full knowledge as a mechanic, she believes there's no machine she can't dissasemble!
    
    Dressed in a jumpsuit-style suit, she wields a massive monkey-wrench-shaped Parallel Weapon in battle.
    This Parallel Weapon can change its form as needed, functioning as a drill or electric saw, and even has the capabilities of a supercomputer.
    
    By analyzing the various data obtained from her equipped goggles using the Parallel Weapon, she can dismantle targets or support her allies with incredible skill.
    
    Her battle style—flexibly switching between offense and support while analyzing the situation—plays a vital behind-the-scenes role in supporting the heroes of Parallel Flight.
  5th_anniversary_true_self: |-
    Crowne, a hero of Parallel Flight , also works as a mechanic for Ramjet Corporation - one of Earth's leading spacecraft manufacturers.
    
    Born in an industrial city advanced by cutting-edge technology and raised surrounded by machines, it was her childhood experiences that inspired her to become a mechanic.

    Whenever she encounters a machine or robot, her mechanic instincts kick in, and she has a bad habit of wanting to dismantle it.

    Despite maintaining an unhealthy diet, favoring alcohol and greasy foods, she surprisingly passes health checkups with flying colors.
    This astonishing fact earns her a mix of awe and envy from her fellow team members.

    As for her fashion sense, although she’s repeatedly critiqued by a fashion designer friend, there are still people who admire Crowne’s unpretentious and down-to-earth style.

    A young girl who dreamed of seeing the most advanced technology in the universe
    remembers her dreams when she was an adult. She decides to hold that dream in
    her heart again, and the result is a hero who fights with a tool that has the
    ability to analyze a variety of mechanisms. The huge tool she carries accurately
    analyzes the performance and structure of any object that she sees. It is also a
    kind of supercomputer that can change into various forms of tools and
    disassemble objects.
  BIO_H02: |-
    A "man" should be this way, a "woman" should be that way... The environment
    around her was always filled with such words. With hobbies and personalities
    that are "masculine" according to those around her, she has always feel out of
    place and wanted to be a "woman" in her own right. The same thing was mentioned
    about her dream, and she longed to have a "womanly" dream. It didn't take long
    for her to abandon her dream once.

    A mechanic affiliated with Ramjet: a spacecraft manufacturing company with the

    She is an in-house mechanic and spaceship pilot who has a partnership agreement
    with the company where the Protagonist works at. An Earthling from Seattle, USA.
    Her full name is Crowne Applefield.

    Her arms are as strong as her spirit, and she abhors being treated with contempt
    "because she's a woman".

    Since she's a geek deeply interested in high tech, when she sees rare mechas or
    robots she has a bad habit of wanting to disassemble them and analyze their
    structure.
