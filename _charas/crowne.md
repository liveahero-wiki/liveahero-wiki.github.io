A young girl who dreamed of seeing the most advanced technology in the universe remembers her dreams when she was an adult.
She decides to hold that dream in her heart again, and the result is a hero who fights with a tool that has the ability to analyze a variety of mechanisms.

A "man" should be this way, a "woman" should be that way... The environment around her was always filled with such words.

The same thing was mentioned about her dream, and she longed to have a "womanly" dream.
It didn't take long for her to abandon her dream once.

A mechanic affiliated with Ramjet: a spacecraft manufacturing company with the largest market share on Earth.

She is an in-house mechanic and spaceship pilot who has a partnership agreement with the company where the Protagonist works at. An Earthling from Seattle, USA. Her full name is Crowne Applefield.

Her arms are as strong as her spirit, and she abhors being treated with contempt "because she's a woman".

Since she's a geek deeply interested in high tech, when she sees rare mechas or robots she has a bad habit of wanting to disassemble them and analyze their structure.
