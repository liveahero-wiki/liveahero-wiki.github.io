Transforms into a hakama-clad hero who carries a parallel weapon in the shape of a huge brush. Using his tail as an inkwell, the energy extracted from his body can be used as ink to form an embodied "living kanji character" in the air. The letters he writes act according to the meaning of the word, and when they finish their actions, they disperse. Shoen's technique has a particular characteristic that the power of the attack and the effect on the target can change according to different meanings of the characters.

His hope is to "write 'living' characters." Every time he sees the letters written in the air gaining life and fulfilling their assigned mission, he becomes keenly aware of his imperfection and regrets it. All of this stems from a supreme book full of incredible writing that he once laid eyes on in a Japanese temple. In the ink marks, he saw a beauty that would never decay no matter how much time passed. He continues to challenge himself with calligraphy, until the day when he can produce such a work with his own hands.
