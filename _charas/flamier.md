With a lab coat flapping like a cape, she transforms into a hero who fights using all kinds of equipment to synthesize and burn chemicals.

However, since her goal is not \[to kill or injure her enemies with explosions\], but \[to make beautiful flames for everyone to see\], her techniques are not as destructive as they are flashy.

Nevertheless, she is a fearsome hero since her goal also means to make the surroundings a \[Sea of Fire\], literally.

Her wish is to \[Make the most beautiful fireworks in the universe blooms at the most beautiful place\].

Combustion can only occur where there is an atmosphere, and on some planets, the reaction does not occur as expected due to the components that make up the atmosphere.

There are many substances that do not even burn in the first place.

That's why to pursue her astounding ideals, she dedicate herself to the research of combustible substances everyday.

Her unusual obsession with fire is probably second to none.

Flamier volunteered to help Hisaki's research and transformed into a hero suit suitable for the Wemalt flower festival.

She wears parallel weapons similar to the dance shoes presented to her by her grandfather as a child.

When the shoes shine, people's eyes naturally gather, and the trail of light  left in the wake of her dance confuses and dazzles the enemy.

Based on her grandfather's teaching that "Enjoy that which sparks your passion with all your might",  Flamier overwhelms the enemy like a  flower petal dancing in the wind.

Since childhood, Flamier has loved to dance. 

However, she was disciplined by her educator to behave in a manner befitting her status, and even as a child, Flamier suppressed her feelings and played the role of what she thought was expected of her. 

It was her grandfather who treated her not only as his granddaughter, but also as a human being, who recognized her feelings and became a person who understood her. 

Her late grandfather's advice that she should be able to love herself with all her heart, no matter who she is, is the foundation on which Flamier now stands.
