  BIO_H01: |-
    With a lab coat flapping like a cape, she transforms into a hero who fights
    using all kinds of equipment to synthesize and burn chemicals.

    However, since her goal is not \[to kill or injure her enemies with
    explosions\], but \[to make beautiful flames for everyone to see\], her
    techniques are not as destructive as they are flashy.

    Nevertheless, she is a fearsome hero since her goal also means to make the
    surroundings a \[Sea of Fire\], literally.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Her wish is to \[Make the most beautiful fireworks in the universe blooms at the
    most beautiful place\].

    Combustion can only occur where there is an atmosphere, and on some planets, the
    reaction does not occur as expected due to the components that make up the
    atmosphere.

    There are many substances that do not even burn in the first place.

    That's why to pursue her astounding ideals, she dedicate herself to the research
    of combustible substances everyday.

    Her unusual obsession with fire is probably second to none.

  BIO_H01: |-
    Flamier volunteered to help Hisaki's research and transformed into a hero suit
    suitable for the Wemalt flower festival.

    She wears parallel weapons similar to the dance shoes presented to her by her
    grandfather as a child.

    When the shoes shine, people's eyes naturally gather, and the trail of light
    left in the wake of her dance confuses and dazzles the enemy.

    Based on her grandfather's teaching that "Enjoy that which sparks your passion
    with all your might",  Flamier overwhelms the enemy like a  flower petal dancing
    in the wind.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Since childhood, Flamier has loved to dance.

    However, she was disciplined by her educator to behave in a manner befitting her
    status, and even as a child, Flamier suppressed her feelings and played the role
    of what she thought was expected of her.

    It was her grandfather who treated her not only as his granddaughter, but also
    as a human being, who recognized her feelings and became a person who understood
    her.

    Her late grandfather's advice that she should be able to love herself with all
    her heart, no matter who she is, is the foundation on which Flamier now stands.

    A chemistry teacher who teaches at one of the top class elite high schools in
    the Lunar capital.

    She is a lunarian from the moon and is the daughter of a businessman who is in
    charge of mining mineral resources from asteroid belts.

    Thanks to her intelligence, talent and beauty she has a lot of admirers inside
    and outside the school.

    She has a strange obsession with "beautiful burning things" and possesses
    extraordinary knowledge of combustibles such as gunpowder and explosives.

    Her dream is to create fireworks that bloom beautifully in space.
