The first time Kyoichi confronted Kaibutsu was at an elementary school he visited for TA training. His natural older brother instinct and his desire to protect younger children gave him the determination to "protect the world for his students," and gave birth to the hero "Element Teacher." On the battlefield, he wields weapons resembling the balls, vaulting boxes, and set squares that he handles in elementary school classes, and shows students "why evil doesn't pay".

His identity as  "Element Teacher" is kept secret from his students, as a special consideration to not endanger the children close to him, and because he does not want to show off his achievements. Even so, he watches with a fond smile as his students play "Element Teacher" at recess.

A teacher working at an elementary school in Orient City

An Earthling from Sendai Japan, his fullname is Kyouichi Ootomo

A former senior of Akashi at university, now a teacher who just began his profession

since he originally aim to be a baseball player, he has exceptional reflexes.

Although he possesses the leadership and magnanimity that children idolize, there is a part of him that aggravates things with his younger friends.

By the way, it seems like "Elementary students are the base he's supposed to defend".
