    The first time Kyoichi confronted Kaibutsu was at an elementary school he
    visited for TA training. His natural older brother instinct and his desire to
    protect younger children gave him the determination to "protect the world for
    his students," and gave birth to the hero "Element Teacher." On the battlefield,
    he wields weapons resembling the balls, vaulting boxes, and set squares that he
    handles in elementary school classes, and shows students "why evil doesn't pay".
  BIO_H02: |-
    His identity as  "Element Teacher" is kept secret from his students, as a
    special consideration to not endanger the children close to him, and because he
    does not want to show off his achievements. Even so, he watches with a fond
    smile as his students play "Element Teacher" at recess.

  BIO_H01: |-
    Kyoichi describes himself in this new form as "Agent of Love, E.T.L.".

    Transformed into this figure, he is a warrior of love on a mission to rescue
    children in the midst of terrorism.

    Because they perceive romance as embarrassing, the children mutually deride one
    another in a negative feedback loop and create their own hell full of anger and
    sadness, with all their secrets exposed.

    As a mature adult, he rescues children and runs through enemy strongholds in a
    black suit, using chalk bullets as a weapon.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Kyoichi is not good at keeping secrets, and so whatever feelings he has for the
    other party, he will advance and lay it bare.

    This is his own attitude developed in order to gain the trust of others.

    However, saying something honestly sometimes doesn't bring about a good result.

    When we communicate too straightforwardly, there will be times when others get
    hurt by it.

    And so when faced with a case which can be called the best example of this
    dilemma, he finds himself greatly perplexed.

    A former senior of Akashi at university, now a teacher who just began his
    profession

    Although he possesses the leadership and magnanimity that children idolize,
    there is a part of him that aggravates things with his younger friends.

    By the way, it seems like "Elementary students are the base he's supposed to
    defend".
