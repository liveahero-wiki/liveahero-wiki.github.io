The first time Kyoichi confronted Kaibutsu was at an elementary school he visited for TA training. His natural older brother instinct and his desire to protect younger children gave him the determination to "protect the world for his students," and gave birth to the hero "Element Teacher." On the battlefield, he wields weapons resembling the balls, vaulting boxes, and set squares that he handles in elementary school classes, and shows students "why evil doesn't pay".

His identity as  "Element Teacher" is kept secret from his students, as a special consideration to not endanger the children close to him, and because he does not want to show off his achievements. Even so, he watches with a fond smile as his students play "Element Teacher" at recess.

By the way, it seems like "Elementary students are the base he's supposed to defend".
