    Zaniah's rose ship-shaped parallel weapon is unlike other whips, the ends branched into 4 leather segment.
  
    It can be used as a weapon to attack, or as a rope to receive treasures,
    It can also be used in a variety of ways, such as as a shield that resembles a flower petal to protect allies in a wide area.
  
    When it opens, it resembles a flower pendant, similar to a treasure given to Xania by her family when she was a child.
  BIO_H02: |-
    After a Kaibutsu disaster, Zaniah was washed up in a slum on an unknown planet and was loved by the natives as if she were their own child or sister.
  
    However due to the financial demands of the land owner there, her new families are forced to live an even worse lives.
  
    In front of a strong being, the weak ones will be entirely exploited. No one will appear to help.
  
    Thinking so, Zaniah stands and walk on. To get back what has been stolen from her family. That wish drive her forward.

    Self-proclaimed phantom thief, Zaniah travels around in search of valuables.
  
    Perhaps because she was treated like a princess from an early age, she is often domineering and unyielding,
    but the purpose of her travels is to repay the kindness of her families in the slums who raised her.
  
    In reality, however, Zania is the type of person who won't stop once she decides to do something, 
    so her families in the slum are very worried when she rushed out of town, they follow her behind buildings, behind trees, and are always cheering her on in the shadows.
