    Pubraseer has regained his memory and awakened to his power as a hero.

    His parallel weapon is a sign of his determination to walk with his men in the
    future, and in his hand he holds a flag to be set up in the uncharted land they
    sought.

    The flag-shaped Parallel Weapon is usually closed and used as a spear, but it
    flutters widely when protecting friends or leading them to a safe zone.

    Pubraseer's hero suit also resembles the design he wore back in those days, when
    he was a starship captain.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Pubraseer's original personality as a young man was carefree and jovial, but the
    responsibility and pressure of being  a spaceship captain hardened him into a
    serious leader with a strong sense of responsibility, almost to the point of
    self-sacrifice.

    In a memory flashback, Pubraseer recovered his memories of the past and thinks
    of his now deceased subordinates, buckling under the weight of his own life that
    was saved by his five friends, and realizing that this life is no longer his
    alone, he raises the flag symbolizing that vow in his hand and stares at the
    bright star of the future.

  BIO_S01: |-
    A sailor handyman who is in charge of clean-up at a spaceship resort.

    He is a beastman alien with a cheerful and carefree personality.

    During the spaceship resort's construction, he protected the nearby sea area.

    He lost his memories pertaining to his time protecting it, and even
    conversations about it are difficult for him,  but because he has a lot more
    curiosity than others, he has managed to absorb how to speak, as well as
    knowledge.

    Sometimes, he hears impossible to understand words from the pendant he was found
    with, which always give him a headache.
