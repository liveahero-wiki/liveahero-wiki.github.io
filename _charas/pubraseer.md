    Pubraseer has regained his memory and awakened to his power as a hero.

    His parallel weapon is a sign of his determination to walk with his men in the
    future, and in his hand he holds a flag to be set up in the uncharted land they
    sought.

    The flag-shaped Parallel Weapon is usually closed and used as a spear, but it
    flutters widely when protecting friends or leading them to a safe zone.

    Pubraseer's hero suit also resembles the design he wore back in those days, when
    he was a starship captain.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Pubraseer's original personality as a young man was carefree and jovial, but the
    responsibility and pressure of being  a spaceship captain hardened him into a
    serious leader with a strong sense of responsibility, almost to the point of
    self-sacrifice.

    In a memory flashback, Pubraseer recovered his memories of the past and thinks
    of his now deceased subordinates, buckling under the weight of his own life that
    was saved by his five friends, and realizing that this life is no longer his
    alone, he raises the flag symbolizing that vow in his hand and stares at the
    bright star of the future.

  BIO_H01: |-
    In a ceremony celebrating the milestone of a hero's birth, Pubraseer reminisces about the day he became a leader.

    The saber-shaped parallel weapon he holds can recreate and summon the energy form of the spaceship he once piloted.
    Additionally, the navigation device-type parallel weapon for space travel emits a gentle light that heals and inspires his 
    companions.
  
    This weapon embodies his wish for everyone to safely reach their destination and return to where they belong.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Upon being appointed as a leader, Pubraseer, once an optimist, developed a resolute will.
    This was a hopeful determination shared with his companions, who, despite their differences, harbored the same dream: "We will 
    embark on a fruitful adventure and return to this place."
  
    As those who shared his hardships were taken from him, Pubraseer began to search for ways to use his remaining life meaningfully.

    With a saber imbued with the wish to carve out a new future, a space compass gifted by his friends, and a suit worn with 
    determination, he was prepared to guide and support his new "friends" with all that has been entrusted to him.

  BIO_S01: |-
    A sailor handyman who is in charge of clean-up at a spaceship resort.

    He is a beastman alien with a cheerful and carefree personality.

    During the spaceship resort's construction, he protected the nearby sea area.

    He lost his memories pertaining to his time protecting it, and even
    conversations about it are difficult for him,  but because he has a lot more
    curiosity than others, he has managed to absorb how to speak, as well as
    knowledge.

    Sometimes, he hears impossible to understand words from the pendant he was found
    with, which always give him a headache.

## Notes
- He has motifs that echo that of the Soviet space dog, Laika, who was one of the very first animals launched into space. She was never expected to survive returning as technology to de-orbit had not yet been developed. She tragically died to overheating hours into the flight.
  - In his base version, his dream was to trailblaze to uncharted areas places in space, much like how Laika was the first dog to enter orbit, the wish was given form in the shape of a flag to be placed in new lands.
  - The new version gives him a new wish of being able to lead his new crew to where they need to go and return safely to where they belong, a feat that Laika was never able to do. This wish is given form in the form of a saber that can recreate a ship.
 
- Pubraseer's name is possibly an anagram of the star La Superba (Publasear > Pubraseer), a star in the constellation Canes Venatici, also known as the Hunting Dogs.
  - Many have assumed that Pubraseer's breed is possibly a type of West Siberian Laika or East Siberian Laika due to his fur color and pattern, they are known as hunting dogs.

- His skill names is in Greek language:
  - Metéoro Kidemónas (μετέωρο κηδεμόνας) : Meteor Guardian
  - évología Komíti (έβολογία κομήτη) : Comet Evology
  - Pénte Anamniseis (πέντε αναμνησεις) : Five Memories
  - Fos Odigós (φως οδηγός) : Fos = light, Odigós = Leader/Guide
  - Astéria Odigós (αστέρια οδηγός) : Astéria = Star, Odigós = Leader/Guide
  - ánoix Méllon (άνοιξ μέλλον) : ánoix = Open, Méllon = Future
 
- His quote in the game start screen (Glorious Rising Moon Event):
  - "LIVE A HERO."
  Four years… it’s quite a profound feeling.
  Let’s reflect on our journey together while gazing at the stars! A celebration with everyone would be great too.
  …An anniversary, huh? I’m feeling all excited about it!!!
