  BIO_S01: |-
    A newbie hero operator. A mysterious alien who calls himself Broker sent them to
    this universe after all their parallel world selves put together into one being.
    Due to the strong influence of the memory of their parallel selves, the memory
    of the one who was originally in this universe is somewhat diluted. Their
    ability to interfere with parallel universes is extremely high compared to other
    observers, which broker claims as "Specially Made".
