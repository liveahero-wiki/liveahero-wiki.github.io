    He transforms into a hero that can show off his best performance as a carpenter.
    Even in this form, he's still undoubtedly a drunkard, but he can use his split-
    toe-shoes-shaped parallel weapon to walk vertically on walls, and then, using
    various tools from his toolbox-shaped parallel weapon, build high quality walls
    and shelters at a speed that no normal person could do.
  BIO_H02: |-
    In his home town, he was raising a family and living a normal life as a
    carpenter, when one day a giant monster attacked, bringing disaster and
    separating him from his family before drifting ashore to Muirauqa IV.  This is
    when he started drinking daily, and it's also when he began his dream of
    building a house that could withstand even a giant monster attack.
    Consequently, when he sees two lovers or two family members get seperated, he
    loses his composure, even if they're strangers to him.

    Based on the design of the costume used at the Wemalt flower festival, Goro got
    a new hero suit.

    In his hand, toys and musical instruments made by his specialty craftsmanship
    are reproduced in the form of pure energy.

    His toy-shaped parallel weapon, which takes the form of various devices to amuse
    children, acts independently to protect allies.

    In addition, from the instrument-shaped parallel weapon that looks like an
    accordion, he can emit sound energy that gives vitality to those around him, and
    play a powerful but gentle sound.
  BIO_H02: |-
    "I don't drink when dealing with children," is a self-imposed rule he lives by.

    It may have been a small promise made as a parent because his beloved child
    didn't like the smell of alcohol.

    Goro, who had lost his child, his family, and even his home to return to, played
    the gentle melody of a lullaby.

    Goro has lived through happy days that he can never get back, and the desire to
    have it back makes him want to break down and cry, with a regret that will never
    wither.

    Nonetheless, he is still alive.

    He is a diligent man who works as a shipwright in charge of repairs and onboard
    construction in a shipboard city in the ocean planet of Muirauqa IV. Originating
    from a different planet, he eventually arrived to Muirauqa IV after wandering.

    He is a lewd optimist with a sloppy personality, a heavy drinker, and an
    irresponsible carpenter that doesn't let go off his bottle of booze even at
    work. Despite this, he possesses firm arms and dexterous fingers. Contrary to
    expectations, he can easily assemble blueprints in his head and has the ability
    to accomplish precise and perfect architecture.
