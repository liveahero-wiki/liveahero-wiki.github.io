    As an information warfare specialist, the hero he transforms into is armed with
    a vast hero database, said to be the best in the universe. From his records and
    memories, he can search for battle data of heroes and Kaibutsu that are closest
    to the current situation, determine the optimal means of attack, and incorporate
    it into his own weapon. At first glance, it seems to be an incredibly versatile
    ability, but if his data on a particular situation is lacking, its performance
    declines dramatically.
  BIO_H02: |-
    He pursues information on heroes, villains, and Kaibutsu with a terrifying
    obsession because of his desire to meet the hero that once saved him. A glorious
    hero who saved the lives of many citizens and vanished without so much as a
    name. A phantom who now exists only in Narihito's hazy memories. Chasing after
    this idol, he puts in his all as a reporter and hero to this day.

    Tracing the ever-fading memories of his childhood, Narihito appears dressed in a
    bright red and gold hero suit.

    The suit's armor is very sturdy, recreating "a material developed by Doctor X
    that blocks any heat and absorbs most shock" from Narihito's memory.

    In addition, the right arm can be transformed into a cannon capable of firing
    energy bullets, and at maximum power, it is powerful enough to blow away
    mountains.

    To protect the children's Christmas, Narihito swear an oath on his right arm.
  BIO_H02: |-
    As the meteorite impact looms, Narihito remembers the superhero he longed to be
    as a child.

    A fictional hero who appears in front of grieving citizens and solves even the
    most difficult problems.

    As an adult, Narihito has learned about reality and can no longer hope to be
    this hero of his dreams but, only now, like that hero, he believe in the peace
    that will come, and strongly wish to protect everyone.

    Whether real or imaginary, his life and heart, saved by heroes, will shine hotly
    in this reality to save someone else, and light up the world.
