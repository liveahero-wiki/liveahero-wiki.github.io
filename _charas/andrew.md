  BIO_H01: |-
    His desire to be a living human is most strongly expressed in his appearance
    when he transforms into a hero.

    When it comes to mechanical life forms, they have various advantages to them
    like high defense and their bodies are adorned with interchangeable heavy
    armaments,  but organic lifeforms have the advantage of being able to construct
    flexible and complex thoughts.

    Although it is a temporary one, his body as a hero, consists of flesh and blood,
    is literally full of life.
  BIO_H02: |-
    He was created during a period of war to collect information regarding organic
    lifeforms, but as he lived blending with other organic lifeforms, he came to be
    attached and envious of them.

    He was fascinated by them because they have flesh and blood unlike himself.

    Then the war ended, he was disposed at the outer space and somehow drifted to a
    place where people toil.

    Until the day he become the same as them, he will continue fighting to protect
    the warmth of people.

  BIO_H01: |-
    During his patrol near a lake, Andrew earned a newfound hero suit that allows
    him to do underwater tasks.

    Although without water jets, by kicking the water with his feet, Andrew is free
    to make laps around any body of water with ease.

    And with parallel weapons covering the mechanical parts of both arms, he is able
    to convert ether into energy, creating water currents and enabling violent
    knuckle attacks.

    His body, which has  characteristics of both a machine and a human body, is a
    physical manifestation of Andrew's newfound determination.
  BIO_H02: |-
    There is a bond between robots and organics that transcends the gap between the
    two.

    Andrew came to know this when he came into contact with the "soul" of livjng
    beings, where the fact of his own cessation of functionality caused grief for
    others.

    Andrew's thought process changed, and he decided to protect that bond.

    No one knows if this behavior can be called a "soul," but Andrew began to search
    for what only he, a mechanical life form, can do in his new form.

    While carefully embracing the massive overflow of errors that he is unable to
    process.

  BIO_S01: |-
    A truck driver for an interplanetary freight forwarding company.

    He looks like an adult earthling male, but is actually an android from the
    machine lifeform star Tronesion.

    Manufactured for espionage during the outbreak of the war between organic and
    mechanical lifeforms.

    Although he is a machine, he has a feeling of compassion and envy for organic
    life forms, and is conducting research every day, hoping to get closer to a
    living human being.

    The mental age is a little young and pure hearted contrary to the impression his
    appearance gives off.
