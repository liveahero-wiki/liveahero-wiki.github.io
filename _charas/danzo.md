    With the spectacular Future + Classical music and a mastery of physical arts reminiscent of a real ninja, Weed Groover is a hero who never ceases to fascinate. His venues always feature flashy acoustics with mesmerizing light beams. 
    
    The battles he "produces" would draw in the crowd, the live viewers, and even the heroes fighting alongside him, turning them into musical live shows. 
    
    But his appeal doesn't stop at showmanship. While captivating the crowd, he is certain to smite any foe that must be punished. It's not uncommon for the audience to get so swept up in the atmosphere, that by the time they realize it, all the villains and Kaibutsu have been cleared out. 
    
    Then, where could he possibly have acquired such incredible combat skills? When asked, he simply replied, "A little karate since I was a kid! *wink*"

    While there are countless heroes active today, there are likely few whose daily life is as shrouded in mystery as his. 
    
    His work as a sound creator is incredibly broad, ranging from music production centered on composing and arranging, to concept production for artists, and even hosting live events where he himself performs in the DJ booth. 
    
    However, while he may be seen in studios, clubs, and at live events, extremely few people have ever seen how he would spend a day off.
    
    Even talents who have worked with him say things like, "If you invite him out for a meal, he'd show up happily, but the instant you say goodbye, he's gone." It's no wonder that rumors have started spreading that he might be a "real-life ninja".
