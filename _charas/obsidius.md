    Obsidius transforms into a hero dressed in a suit reminiscent of a miner, complete with helmet and work clothes.
    His jackhammer-shaped parallel weapon in his hand becomes harder depending on the amount of knowledge Obsidius has about the object       being drilled.
    Even if the target cannot be shattered with a single blow, if even a small part of it can be broken away,
    the structure information of the target will be obtained from the fragments and the jackhammer's power will increase.
    In the end, with enough persistence it will become the hardest jackhammer to "break through the unknown" and crush anything.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Obsidius was living in an orphanage as far back as he can remember.
    The only clue to his origin was a bangle made of an unknown ore that he had worn since birth.
    What is the ore used in the bangles? Is there a planet that produces the same ore? Is it home? All kinds of unknowns trouble him.         With a dream of "breaking through all unknowns" in his heart, he travels around the galaxy.

  BIO_S01: |-
    Obsidious is an alien therianthrope - a minerology academic who resides in the Orient City University.
    He is a field worker who goes around in the galaxy in search of rare ores,
    and his curiosity and desire to dive into the unknown is matched by his toughness.
    He is Marfik's colleague and during his time in the university before becoming a Professor,
    he had a student/mentor relationship with him.
    Because his main area of research is on-site, he is very bad with machinery that require precision.
    Because he grew up in an orphanage and took care of younger children all the time, he now has a very caring attitude,
    similar to that of an older brother.
