    The hero "La Gentiane," clad in pure white armor, excels in battle by protecting her allies with a massive shield as tall as she is.
    
    Though she appears slender, her physique—honed through rigorous training as a riot police officer, boasts considerable muscle mass.

    Her powerful shield bash, unleashed with that strength, packs enough force to take down villains who mistakenly assume she's merely a defensive fighter.

    Many fans admire not only her strength, but also the dignified and graceful way she carries herself, embodying both power and poise.
  5th_anniversary_true_self: |-
    A member of the French National Gendarmerie, she’s widely known for being tough.
    
    No matter how harsh the situation, she never goes down—earning her the nickname “The Iron Wall” from her fellow officers, spoken with both respect and awe.

    Though she may appear flawless both professionally and personally, everything changes when it comes to the superhero “Zap the Justice.”
    
    Her usually composed and dignified expression transforms completely, her eyes sparkling like any ordinary fan her age, as she passionately gushes about how amazing her favorite hero (Justice) is.

    Incidentally, she also serves as the head of the French branch of Justice’s fan club, “Fan the Justice,” and apparently this branch's enthusiastic activities are said to be the most devoted in the entire organization.
