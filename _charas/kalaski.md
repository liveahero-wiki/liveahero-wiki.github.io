    His camera-type parallel weapon can literally "freeze a moment", and when the
    shutter is released, the target in the frame stops moving for a certain period
    of time.

    The duration is as short as a few seconds and it is not stable, but when the
    path to the parallel world is opened to the maximum, it is possible to stop for
    a longer time and a wider range than before.

    "5 seconds... more than enough."

    In that short time, he attacks his enemies with high physical ability that
    belies his petite body.

    Born in a city in the midst of a civil war, Kalaski has managed to survive while
    being separated from his family in the conflict.

    With nearly 30 years of life experience, he has traveled through numerous
    conflict zones, sneaking through sometimes life-threatening situations and
    taking photographs.

    He considers it his mission to capture every moment of life's life, which is
    born and disappears like bubbles on the battlefield, and keep it as a semi-
    permanent record.

    After enjoying his vacation, Kalaski accepts a request for a warm up.
    The request is to create a record that leads to the final days of a hotel set to be closed.

    For the sake of showing the scenery that will soon disappear to those customers who have ever stayed there, Kalaski continues      to press his shutter.
    While doing the job, Kalaski somehow ended up appearing in the hotel's exciting show, using parallel cue to transform.
    The resulting hero suit is a glittering form suited for a performer on stage.
  
    He fight while being illuminated by a spotlight parallel weapon in his hand.
    That appearance catches the viewer's eye and inspires their hearts.
  BIO_H02: |-
    A photo that Kalaski once took.
    While riding a spaceship together with survivors who have lost their home, within the gloomy and depressed people,
    a person raised their head and began singing a song from a movie in their homeland with a smile.

    “Our planet is gone, even if that fact is going to be just a sad piece of news one day, we will continue singing, and live”,
    remembering the words spoken by the person back then, Kalaski stand on the stage.
    Even though this is not a battlefield,
    for the sake of conveying and connecting the scream of the disappearing way of life here…
