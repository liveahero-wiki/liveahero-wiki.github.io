    His camera-type parallel weapon can literally "freeze a moment", and when the
    shutter is released, the target in the frame stops moving for a certain period
    of time.

    The duration is as short as a few seconds and it is not stable, but when the
    path to the parallel world is opened to the maximum, it is possible to stop for
    a longer time and a wider range than before.

    "5 seconds... more than enough."

    In that short time, he attacks his enemies with high physical ability that
    belies his petite body.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Born in a city in the midst of a civil war, Kalaski has managed to survive while
    being separated from his family in the conflict.

    With nearly 30 years of life experience, he has traveled through numerous
    conflict zones, sneaking through sometimes life-threatening situations and
    taking photographs.

    He considers it his mission to capture every moment of life's life, which is
    born and disappears like bubbles on the battlefield, and keep it as a semi-
    permanent record.

    A tiger-beast alien who is a battlefield photographer, he has photographed the
    situation and soldiers on numerous battlefields.

    His species takes nearly twice as long to grow as compared to earthlings, he
    looks like a child but is actually in his late twenties.

    Aware of his job as a professional battlefield photographer, he tries to keep
    his feelings in check and stay away from another's private matters, he also does
    not like it when others get involved too deeply with him.

    However, he can't dismiss others' friendly attitude towards him, he act like
    it's a bother but actually is not really annoyed by it.

    He tries to act cool, but actually easily offended.
