    Western is a film genre popular in the first half of the 20th century.
    Symphonic Trigger, is a hero whose appearance emulates the genre's
    iconic figure: the gunslinging sheriff.

    True to his name, which means "symphonizing triggers", he skillfully wields
    two pistol-type Parallel Weapons at once, gunning down his foes with
    unerring marksmanship.

    While his accuracy is said to be aided by corrections from the Parallel
    Weapon, his outstanding martial arts prowess is, even taking that into
    account, something to behold.

    As for his mobility and adaptability, which are unheard of for a rookie
    cop, was said to be was thoroughly developed at a UEHA facility.

    However, since the educational programs at said facility are classified and
    press coverage is forbidden, the details have only become a subject of
    greater curiosity.
  5th_anniversary_true_self: |-
    He works for the Orient City Police Community Division, assigned to a
    koban (police box). The city's koban officers work a four-shift system.
    While there is apparently some flexibility, his life is fundamentally a
    repeating cycle of day shifts, night shifts, off-duty days, and holidays.

    While his hero duties are added on top of all that, one can easily
    imagine how busy he must be, yet he himself always appears to be
    cheerful and full of life.

    Thanks to his friendliness, easygoing personality, and his inability to
    ignore someone in trouble, it seems many citizens are fans of him both
    as a police officer and as a hero.

    His hobbies include watching movies and going to the gym, and on the
    more niche side, collecting model guns. Surprisingly, while he has held
    model guns, airsoft guns, gas guns, and his police-issued
    electromagnetic tranquilizer gun countless times, it is said that he has
    never once held a real firearm.

    He transforms into "Symphonic Trigger", a hero who wears a costume that
    resembles the sheriff in a western movie that he has admired since he was a
    child. With twin pistol-type parallel weapons, he subdue his target with quick
    draw shots. When transformed, different from his usual poor skills, he can shoot
    with one hundred percent accuracy. In battle, shooting energy bullets as much as
    he wants, he always looks like he's having a lot of fun.
  BIO_H02: |-
    He appears gallantly in front of evil-doers and punish them with his twin guns.
    Today, he keeps the peace in the city and leaves with the setting sun on his
    back... a western movie that is often treated as old-fashioned, but he was
    captivated by it. He wanted to be a "righteous gunman" like that sheriff who
    fights to do justice. Such a wish transformed him into an unprecedented police
    hero.

  BIO_H01: |-
    After displaying his desire to be able to have appropriate battles under the
    scorching sun, Barrel managed to summon a new hero form for himself. Thanks to
    Barrel's newfound motivation/fighting spirit given to him by his new form, he
    equipped multiple water guns which shoot violent water splashes and he now
    dances around the battlefield, managing to gain popularity and points while also
    appealing to his audience with his refreshing, handsome face. The water in the
    tank attached to his gun is infinite as long as he has energy to supply it with.
  BIO_H02: |-
    He had been practing his aim for a long time, longing to be a good-looking
    gunslinger, and it was quite a shock for him to be overpowered by another in
    terms of "attractiveness" in battle. It was as if he had been exposed to a
    weakness that gunslingers, who are always exposed to fire and heat, cannot
    avoid. What gave him inspiration was the intense water aiming skill of his
    friend, the fireman hero, at a water pistol target shooting stall. As a lover of
    summer and the water, it was inevitable that he would want to be a hero who
    deals with water and is appropriate for summer.

  BIO_S01: |-
    A Police officer from Orient City's municipal police department, working in a
    police box. An alien who grew up in Houston, USA. Honest, straightforward and
    very friendly, a model police officer if not for his excessive adoration for
    western sheriffs and tendency to jump to conclusions at the drop of a hat. He
    uses a tranquilizer gun, but have very poor shooting skills, no matter how many
    rounds are fired he can't hit his target, not even the surrounding onlookers
    have ever got hit.
