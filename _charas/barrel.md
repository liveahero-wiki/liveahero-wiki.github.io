    He transforms into "Symphonic Trigger", a hero who wears a costume that
    resembles the sheriff in a western movie that he has admired since he was a
    child. With twin pistol-type parallel weapons, he subdue his target with quick
    draw shots. When transformed, different from his usual poor skills, he can shoot
    with one hundred percent accuracy. In battle, shooting energy bullets as much as
    he wants, he always looks like he's having a lot of fun.
  BIO_H02: |-
    He appears gallantly in front of evil-doers and punish them with his twin guns.
    Today, he keeps the peace in the city and leaves with the setting sun on his
    back... a western movie that is often treated as old-fashioned, but he was
    captivated by it. He wanted to be a "righteous gunman" like that sheriff who
    fights to do justice. Such a wish transformed him into an unprecedented police
    hero.

  BIO_H01: |-
    After displaying his desire to be able to have appropriate battles under the
    scorching sun, Barrel managed to summon a new hero form for himself. Thanks to
    Barrel's newfound motivation/fighting spirit given to him by his new form, he
    equipped multiple water guns which shoot violent water splashes and he now
    dances around the battlefield, managing to gain popularity and points while also
    appealing to his audience with his refreshing, handsome face. The water in the
    tank attached to his gun is infinite as long as he has energy to supply it with.
  BIO_H02: |-
    He had been practing his aim for a long time, longing to be a good-looking
    gunslinger, and it was quite a shock for him to be overpowered by another in
    terms of "attractiveness" in battle. It was as if he had been exposed to a
    weakness that gunslingers, who are always exposed to fire and heat, cannot
    avoid. What gave him inspiration was the intense water aiming skill of his
    friend, the fireman hero, at a water pistol target shooting stall. As a lover of
    summer and the water, it was inevitable that he would want to be a hero who
    deals with water and is appropriate for summer.

  BIO_S01: |-
    A Police officer from Orient City's municipal police department, working in a
    police box. An alien who grew up in Houston, USA. Honest, straightforward and
    very friendly, a model police officer if not for his excessive adoration for
    western sheriffs and tendency to jump to conclusions at the drop of a hat. He
    uses a tranquilizer gun, but have very poor shooting skills, no matter how many
    rounds are fired he can't hit his target, not even the surrounding onlookers
    have ever got hit.
