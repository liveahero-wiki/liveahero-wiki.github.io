  BIO_H01: |-
    The parallel weapon, in the form of a conductor's baton, specializes in
    collecting View Power, and when he raises his right hand, the eyes of ordinary
    observers are riveted.

    It commands various instrumental drones and provides support and assistance in
    battle through the tones it plays.

    The Parallel Weapon's enhanced abilities work against Borealis' natural ability
    to "hear the sounds of others," and in turn allow him to propagate and activate
    emotions and energy into the minds of others.

    He also use this ability during his own concerts to mesmerize the audience.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Borealis has the innate ability to "hear" the inner sounds of others.

    Listening to other people's emotions and thoughts unconsciously was very
    mentally taxing for Borealis himself, but he was supported by his close friends
    and family.

    To reach them who have disappeared, Borealis persisted to collect a lot of
    Views.

    As Borealis resonates with the sounds of others, he puts his own and others'
    thoughts into the sounds and makes them resonate in the hearts of the listeners.

    Hoping that one day it may reach them.

  BIO_S01: |-
    A conductor who conducts and performs using flying instrument drones.

    He was born on a small, frigid planet with a small population, but it was lost
    due to a meteorite impact.

    He used to be a hero, but since his planet's destruction, he has dropped all
    contact with his hero office and uses his power only for himself.

    The concerts held in the theater spaceship he owns are watched all over the
    galaxy and boast a tremendous audience rating every time.

    Only a handful of supporters and favored guests are invited to personally attend
    the theatre spacecraft live.
