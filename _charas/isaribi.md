Isaribi transforms into a hero who takes advantage of his experience as a fisherman. Due to him being very exposed, he has a device on his waist which helps him with defense. His two parallel weapons are a harpoon and a glove. He is able to shoot out a cast net that expands depending on the size of its target before capturing it. He is then able to attack with his harpoon once the enemy's movement has been blocked with the cast net. He's a little dumb, so he is very vulnerable to opponents who can outsmart him.

When he was a novice fisherman, he was eaten by a large fish during a storm. However he was saved by a hero who dove straight into the action and saved him, but ended up disappearing into the jet black bottom of the ocean. Since that day, he's wanted a rematch with the person who saved him and until that dream of his becomes true, he wants to continue to be a hero fisherman.

{% capture BIO_S01 %}
An alien fisherman who partakes in the inshore fishing industry and uses the rich sea of the ocean planet Muirauqa IV as a fishing ground. He is awfully emotional, easily moved to tears, rash, quick to lose temper; he's the true depiction of the Edoite man.

Confident in his vigorous stamina and muscles, he recklessly gets into fights, pokes his nose into other people's affairs, and is eager to get undressed. If you praise him for his physical strength or his good looks, he will be in a good mood. He lives in the same shipboard city and neighborhood as the carpenter Gorou. They're bad friends, but good drinking friends.
