  5th_anniversary_intro: |-
    Isaribi is a fisherman hero whose name is renowned across the great oceans of Muirauka IV. The items produced by his glove-type Parallel Weapon, such as casting nets, spears, and baskets, truly resemble the distinct look and feel of a fisherman's gear. 
    
    However, his opponents are not just limited to fish and marine-type Kaibutsu. He puts on a reliable display against land-based Kaibutsu and villains who threaten the city's peace, either by stopping them in their tracks or finishing them off directly. 
    
    Due to his base of operations and his profession, there aren't many chances to see him in the Earth Sphere, but his name and visual design may suggest that he is a hero with surprisingly deep ties to Earth (Japan in particular). He is definitely one to keep an eye out for. 
  5th_anniversary_true_self: |-
    Holding the title "Federally Registered Fisherman of the Novohook Bay Fishing Plant", a designation unfamiliar in the Earth Sphere, he is a fisherman living in the City Fleet Estebolta, diligently piling up his trades every day. 
    
    His work routine is not so different from that of a fisherman from the Earth Sphere. He prepares his boat and sets out before sunrise, heading for the fishing grounds known as the Fishing Plant (designated points where marine life can be caught). 
    
    There, he sets out his gear according to his quarry; sometimes pulling in nets, reeling in longlines, or simply dropping a fishing line. Afterwards, he brings his catch back to Estebolta to sell at the market. 
    
    Due to the unique nature of the ship-based city, which must rely on imports for agricultural products and cannot actively practice animal husbandry, the seafood brought to shore by fishermen like him is an essential lifeline. 
    
    He heads out to the fishing grounds each day with pride, seeking to fill the stomachs of the people in his beloved city.

  BIO_H01: |-
    Isaribi transforms into a hero who takes advantage of his experience as a
    fisherman. Due to him being very exposed, he has a device on his waist which
    helps him with defense. His two parallel weapons are a harpoon and a glove. He
    is able to shoot out a cast net that expands depending on the size of its target
    before capturing it. He is then able to attack with his harpoon once the enemy's
    movement has been blocked with the cast net. He's a little dumb, so he is very
    vulnerable to opponents who can outsmart him.
  BIO_H02: |-
    When he was a novice fisherman, he was eaten by a large fish during a storm.
    However he was saved by a hero who dove straight into the action and saved him,
    but ended up disappearing into the jet black bottom of the ocean. Since that
    day, he's wanted a rematch with the person who saved him and until that dream of
    his becomes true, he wants to continue to be a hero fisherman.

  BIO_S01: |-
    An alien fisherman who partakes in the inshore fishing industry and uses the
    rich sea of the ocean planet Muirauqa IV as a fishing ground. He is awfully
    emotional, easily moved to tears, rash, quick to lose temper; he's the true
    depiction of the Edoite man.

    Confident in his vigorous stamina and muscles, he recklessly gets into fights,
    pokes his nose into other people's affairs, and is eager to get undressed. If
    you praise him for his physical strength or his good looks, he will be in a good
    mood. He lives in the same shipboard city and neighborhood as the carpenter
    Gorou. They're bad friends, but good drinking friends.
