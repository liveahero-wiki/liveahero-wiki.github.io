    The blade-type parallel weapon extending from the forearm is a further enhancement of Gaisei's racial characteristic, where the bones     of his body are as hard as metal.

    This hard blade can cut through metal, and the skeletal armor that protects him is all derived from Gaisei's original physical form.

    As a result, the hero suit features an open design that does not hinder movement, symbolizing Gaisei's determination to surpass his       opponents with his own body and skills, showcasing his overwhelming strength.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Gaisei, raised in an orphanage on a remote planet with a stark divide between the rich and poor, has witnessed from a young age how       the strong take everything from the weak.

    Even the head of the orphanage, who taught him martial arts and protected the children, was trampled by a more powerful force.

    With this reality ingrained in him, Gaisei later left the sheltered planet and now roams the galaxy in search of battlefields where       he can confront the strong. He seeks to experience firsthand the belief that strength determines everything.

  BIO_S01: |-
    He is a young alien with a humanoid appearance who works as a bodyguard for a pawn shop and antique dealer with a troubled past.
  
    He finds joy only in honing his skills and defeating strong opponents. If a battle with a formidable foe is guaranteed, he will leave     his employer behind and rush into any battlefield as a bodyguard, regardless of who hires him.

    When it comes to battle, he charges in with a cold smile, eagerly embracing the chaos.
    However, he has little interest in anything outside of fighting; often, he appears lost in thought, especially during times that          aren’t dedicated to battle or training.
