  BIO_H01: |-
    Victom transforms into "Survive taker" when he dresses up in a suit and armor
    closely resembling that of a rescue squad uniform. He possesses a rope which
    allows him to reach his rescue target in the shortest distance possible even if
    they are in the belly of a kaibutsu.  He makes the best use of his suit and rope
    which have the ability to break through any obstacle; that allows him to carry
    out rescue missions at the speed of sound.
  BIO_H02: |-
    His desire/wish is "to have the power to rescue all the weak and powerless
    people who are threatened." It it something that he swore to do after he saw his
    entire family that disappeared (died) in a city that was once attacked and
    burned by a ravenous/aggressive kaibutsu. Despite having numerous injuries to
    his face under the helmet he wears, the reason he continues to do his best to
    help others is out of a desire for revenge against kaibutsu.

  BIO_H01: |-
    Victom, who sees the act of saving others' lives by throwing himself into the
    action a top priority, has gained a new hero outfit, specializing in lifesaving
    activities by the waterside. By skillfully controlling his paddle board, he
    slips through the gaps between the waves and cheers up those whose lives are in
    danger with a dazzling smile... and because that is very unusual for the usual
    Victom, people become quite frightened/surprised when they see him. Apparently
    something happened during the summer festival that lead to such a change.
  BIO_H02: |-
    A reticent, straightforward man who always wears a mask.  That is the impression
    that the public and hero fans have about Victor.  He doesn't deny that he's a
    gruff, even stoic man, but he seems to have some worries about being seen as
    scary because of his rigor.  The event in which he mistakenly caused a child on
    the beach to cry while returning their ball shook his heart. "I want to be the
    kind of hero who can make that child smile..." Maybe it was because he once had
    a family that he had such a desire.

  BIO_S01: |-
    The commanding officer of Orient City Fire Department's Hyper Rescue team,
    always wearing a full face helmet.

    Originating from London, England. His full name is Victom Vincent.

    Calm and stoic, he is a man who is as much of a life saver as possible,
    possessing an oustanding situational awareness ability.

    Even though he believes that all lives are precious, there is a side of him that
    follows the saying of "To Live for others, and to die for others", so he tends
    to look down on his life.
