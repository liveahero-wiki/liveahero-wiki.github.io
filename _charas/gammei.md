  BIO_H01: |-
    Gammei transforms into Justy Arrester with a handcuff-shaped ring that has a
    long chain which infinitely extends. Due to the ring and chain's ability to
    expand and contract according to the captured target's size, he is able to
    "arrest" anyone and anything regardless of size. His fighting skills on the
    battlefield are backed up by his experience as a detective and a hero, as well
    as his memory of originating from a metropolitan area that was destroyed by
    kaibutsu
  BIO_H02: |-
    Self proclaimed "gutter cleaner", his work is by no means as glorious as his
    hero name. There are very few clear evidences left in the cases involving
    villain and kaibutsu. Since many of them could end up unresolved, the police
    wanted a solution that only a hero could provide. Because of that he's going to
    be put to work on everything, and he's going to have to tidy up everything. So
    he goes to the scene of the crime today, complaining about it.

    A detective from Orient City's municipal police department, positioned as a
    police sergeant for the institution. He is assigned to be the one in charge of
    investigating and supervising cases and incidents related to kaibutsu and
    villains. An earthling from Chiba, Japan. His full name is Gammei Tsukinowa.
    Despite looking apathetic and without a care, he takes his job as a policeman
    very seriously. Because he belongs to the middle management, he is oftentimes
    thrown several burdens from both above and below his position, So troubles never
    seem to end for him. His old looking face and meagre salary are the roots of his
    anguish.
