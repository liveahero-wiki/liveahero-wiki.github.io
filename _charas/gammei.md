  BIO_H01: |-
    Gammei transforms into Justy Arrester with a handcuff-shaped ring that has a
    long chain which infinitely extends. Due to the ring and chain's ability to
    expand and contract according to the captured target's size, he is able to
    "arrest" anyone and anything regardless of size. His fighting skills on the
    battlefield are backed up by his experience as a detective and a hero, as well
    as his memory of originating from a metropolitan area that was destroyed by
    kaibutsu
  BIO_H02: |-
    Self proclaimed "gutter cleaner", his work is by no means as glorious as his
    hero name. There are very few clear evidences left in the cases involving
    villain and kaibutsu. Since many of them could end up unresolved, the police
    wanted a solution that only a hero could provide. Because of that he's going to
    be put to work on everything, and he's going to have to tidy up everything. So
    he goes to the scene of the crime today, complaining about it.

  BIO_H01: |-
    In order to conduct an undercover operation in the city during the festival season, 
    UEHA commissioned Gammei to transform into a fighting form through parallel queue.
    After the strong light faded, he was dressed in a new hero suit, festival costume style.
    The parallel weapon in his hand called matoi, in the old days was used by Japan's firemen, 
    in present day it's used by the vanguard of festival procession.
    Wielding that, he rampages around the battlefield as if it's a garden.
  BIO_H02: |-
    He recalls his hometown. Life in the devastated city was never easy.
    But the experiences he had there were irreplaceable for Gammei as a boy and became his starting point.
    Justy Arrester is a hero who protects citizens.
    He realizes that it is a way of life that transcends position and role, and is the way he himself wants to live.
    Wearing the outfit that signifies the sunny day that the citizens look forward to, he lifts his matoi high up.
