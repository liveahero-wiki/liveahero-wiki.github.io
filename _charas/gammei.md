    The greatest characteristic of the resourceful detective hero, Justy Arrester,
    is undoubtedly his main weapon - a pair of handcuffs that can freely
    expand and contract, possessing powerful restraining capabilities.

    Their use is not limited to simply immobilizing villains by restraining their
    limbs. From Kaibutsu and getaway cars to even runaway trains, he is highly
    valued on the scene of any incident, because he can invariably stop anything he
    sets as a target for capture.

    However, the wielder of this Parallel Weapon is also the key himself. He thinks
    calmly and deliberately, acts with agility and adaptability, and activates his
    weapon only after taking aim based on a prediction of his target's movements.

    It is precisely because he can accomplish all this, that his exploits are
    celebrated enough to make the news day after day
  5th_anniversary_true_self: |-
    Throughout the Earth Sphere, incidents involving villains and Kaibutsu
    are a constant threat. This is, of course, no different in Orient City, the
    jurisdiction where he works.

    He belongs to a special team called the "Hero-Related Incidents Special
    Investigation Unit" and works diligently day in and day out to solve cases
    that cannot be handled by non-hero police officers.

    Although he often mocks his own daily duties, calling them "sewer
    dredging" or "a thankless job with no chance of promotion," he
    nevertheless seems to approach his work with a sense of pride, viewing
    it as a job that someone has to do.

    When I asked this busy man how he spends his days off, he was at a
    loss for an answer.

    It seems that days off are a rarity for him, and that he himself is content
    with the situation as is.

    It may seem strange to an outside onlooker, but he seems to enjoy his
    lifestyle: spending his rare holidays relaxing and visiting a bar with a
    nice atmosphere whenever the mood strikes.

    Gammei transforms into Justy Arrester with a handcuff-shaped ring that has a
    long chain which infinitely extends. Due to the ring and chain's ability to
    expand and contract according to the captured target's size, he is able to
    "arrest" anyone and anything regardless of size. His fighting skills on the
    battlefield are backed up by his experience as a detective and a hero, as well
    as his memory of originating from a metropolitan area that was destroyed by
    kaibutsu
  BIO_H02: |-
    Self proclaimed "gutter cleaner", his work is by no means as glorious as his
    hero name. There are very few clear evidences left in the cases involving
    villain and kaibutsu. Since many of them could end up unresolved, the police
    wanted a solution that only a hero could provide. Because of that he's going to
    be put to work on everything, and he's going to have to tidy up everything. So
    he goes to the scene of the crime today, complaining about it.

  BIO_H01: |-
    In order to conduct an undercover operation in the city during the festival season, 
    UEHA commissioned Gammei to transform into a fighting form through parallel queue.
    After the strong light faded, he was dressed in a new hero suit, festival costume style.
    The parallel weapon in his hand called matoi, in the old days was used by Japan's firemen, 
    in present day it's used by the vanguard of festival procession.
    Wielding that, he rampages around the battlefield as if it's a garden.
  BIO_H02: |-
    He recalls his hometown. Life in the devastated city was never easy.
    But the experiences he had there were irreplaceable for Gammei as a boy and became his starting point.
    Justy Arrester is a hero who protects citizens.
    He realizes that it is a way of life that transcends position and role, and is the way he himself wants to live.
    Wearing the outfit that signifies the sunny day that the citizens look forward to, he lifts his matoi high up.
