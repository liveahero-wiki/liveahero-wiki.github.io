After putting on a pure white mantle and utilizing the power of lightning, he transforms into the S rank licensed hero "Zap the justice" to fight evil. He has the ability to create and store energy and electricity in his body. Once he balls his paws into fists or uses his feet, he is able to create an attack made from lightning which resembles that of lighting that rains down from the sky. He can adjust the power of his electricity between the levels of a stun gun and a furious lightning storm.

"To remain a superhero who embodies/personifies justice" is the lightning hero's wish.  It was something that he once spoke to his former partner who fought together with him in a tag team, and was also a vow that he declared to his friends/allies who fell on the battlefield.  Before he became the superhero "Zap the Justice", who laughed loudly in the face of any predicament and showed majestic dignity, there were days of extraordinary efforts and regretful and tearful battles.

The strongest sales employee in the company where the Protagonist works at; he's a superhero who takes pride in his top-class achievements all around the world.

He originates from a different planet, and because static electricity is constantly accumulated on his body hair due to an innate high electric disposition, all of his clothes are made with insulating materials.

He is a hot-blooded man fully aware and confident in his role as a hero, and because of that, he is always wearing a half-mask that resembles the headgear he wears when he transforms.

His voice is always loud.
