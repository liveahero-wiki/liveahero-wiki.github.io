  BIO_H01: |-
    After putting on a pure white mantle and utilizing the power of lightning, he
    transforms into the S rank licensed hero "Zap the justice" to fight evil. He has
    the ability to create and store energy and electricity in his body. Once he
    balls his paws into fists or uses his feet, he is able to create an attack made
    from lightning which resembles that of lighting that rains down from the sky. He
    can adjust the power of his electricity between the levels of a stun gun and a
    furious lightning storm.
  BIO_H02: |-
    "To remain a superhero who embodies/personifies justice" is the lightning hero's
    wish.  It was something that he once spoke to his former partner who fought
    together with him in a tag team, and was also a vow that he declared to his
    friends/allies who fell on the battlefield.  Before he became the superhero "Zap
    the Justice", who laughed loudly in the face of any predicament and showed
    majestic dignity, there were days of extraordinary efforts and regretful and
    tearful battles.

  BIO_H01: |-
    He should have been resting due to an injury, but he was temporarily revived as
    a new hero, triggered by a certain thought and an event/incident. He is in a
    drunken state due to the fact that he is hypersensitive to a certain plant that
    gives ecstasy to certain species. However, it can be said that this appearance
    was obtained due to being drunk as a result of the emotions that had been
    accumulated, exploding and accelerating the feelings toward "a certain wish".
    The injured part of his body seems to be reinforced/strengthened firmly.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Like a banquet dancer, he wears a flashy kimono and dances on the battlefield
    with a fan and thunder. It is a one-time costume that he's put on that was born
    out of the desire to at least end the battle early and hold a feast for his
    junior colleagues. Due to his drunken state, he has feelings of guilt towards
    the junior colleagues that he has burdened due to him being on leave, as well as
    the fact that he is restricted from activities that make him who he is. After
    waking up from his drunkenness, he will surely fall into self-pity and tell
    himself that he was selfish.

  BIO_S01: |-
    The strongest sales employee in the company where the Protagonist works at; he's
    a superhero who takes pride in his top-class achievements all around the world.

    He originates from a different planet, and because static electricity is
    constantly accumulated on his body hair due to an innate high electric
    disposition, all of his clothes are made with insulating materials.

    He is a hot-blooded man fully aware and confident in his role as a hero, and
    because of that, he is always wearing a half-mask that resembles the headgear he
    wears when he transforms.

    His voice is always loud.

## Notes

- Ryekie and his species' fondess and sensitivity to kiwifruits is a reference to a certain type of kiwifruit popularly called [silvervine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinidia_polygama) or matatabi (マタタビ) known for its cat attractant qualities that is reported to be stronger than that of [catnip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catnip).
