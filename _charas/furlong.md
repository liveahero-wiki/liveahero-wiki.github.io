Furlong vowed/swore an oath to "become a firefighter hotter than flames" and transforms into a brave and hot hero "Burn Striker" who is the opposite of what he usually is/does. Once he transforms, no matter how dangerous or perilous a situation may be, he will dive head-first into the fierce fire whilst proclaiming that lifesaving is the highest priority. The change in personality is NOT due to the weapon (pump) on his back, but rather transformation itself calls forth the 'sleeping' courage within him to overtake the fears he has.

A firefighter belonging to Orient City's fire department.

He's an alien from another world. His full name is Hull Furlong Hale.

His basal body temperature is higher than average because he originates from a planet that has a relatively hotter climate in comparision to Earth's.

Because he's resistant to high temperatures, he's helpful at rescuing lives from fires.

Usually shy and timid, he's a scaredy-cat that loves peace.

He talks with everyone except Barrel in a honorifix form, who is close in age and so only one person on an equal basis.
