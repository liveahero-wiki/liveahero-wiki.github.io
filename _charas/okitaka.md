    He is transformed into "The Commander", a military hero with a fan and a shogi
    board that can be used as weapons. He is a rare type of hero who is better at
    fighting strategically and leading others than fighting individually, and can
    perform various simulations using the shogi board that can display both allies
    and enemies. As he moves his pieces on the board, he collaborates with the
    operators to plan strategies and inspires his allies with his military fan,
    which can inflame the morale of the troops, to lead the team to victory

    In his mind, he was constantly torn between the frustration of not being able to
    go out into the field as he was usually in the command center giving orders, and
    the fear that he would be a burden to the heroes on his side by joining the
    ranks after being out of the field for so long. Although he may seem frivolous,
    he has a strong sense of responsibility, and he chooses to take a step back,
    biting back the frustration. When he stands on the battlefield, how the battle
    situation will move...even he himself does not know.

    A middle-aged man who works for the administrative department of the General
    Affairs Bureau of Orient City's City Hall and also serves as the general
    commander of the UEHA Japan branch. An earthling from Osaka, Japan, his full
    name is Takadono Okitaka. With his cheerful and sociable personality and affable
    manner, he doesn't come across like a person in a key internal management
    position, but his wisdom as a commander is outstanding. The tight-knit working
    relationship between UEHA and Parallel Flight is due to the fact that he, Ryekie
    and Huckle formed a deep bond after a joint battle.
