    The phrase "The name reflects the person" is most appropriate for "The Commander".
    
    He’s a rather unconventional hero, specializing in strategic leadership from the rear lines. While working closely with the team’s operator, he adapts to shifting situations and guides his team to victory through carefully crafted tactics.

    And yet, this role is one that only he could truly fulfill.

    Backed by a long career as a hero, his keen insight and extraordinary intellect give rise to logical, efficient strategies that leave everyone in awe.
    
    His calm and charismatic personality doesn’t just win over fans—it also earns the trust and admiration of his fellow heroes and operators, making him the irreplaceable brain of any mission.

    While he holds the position of Supreme Commander of the UEHA Japan Branch, he also works in a civilian capacity as a managerial staff member in the General Affairs Division of Orient City Hall—though his exact title remains undisclosed.
    
    On a daily basis, he reviews various development proposals and handles administrative coordination tasks to ensure the smooth operation of city governance. It's a "Plain" role (as remarked by himself), yet is undeniably crucial to the city’s functioning.

    At the same time, he maintains close communication with UEHA branches across Japan, managing personnel assignments and supporting mission planning—a lifestyle that goes far beyond what most people could handle.

    Despite his overwhelming workload, his calm and cheerful demeanor doesn't show how busy he is, which is also one of his charms.
    When asked about his hobbies, he mentioned bar hopping, reading, and gaming.
    
    As for games, his interests range widely—from classics like shogi and chess to trading card games and full-scale strategy simulations. Unsurprisingly, he gravitates toward games that require deep strategic thinking.

    He is transformed into "The Commander", a military hero with a fan and a shogi
    board that can be used as weapons. He is a rare type of hero who is better at
    fighting strategically and leading others than fighting individually, and can
    perform various simulations using the shogi board that can display both allies
    and enemies. As he moves his pieces on the board, he collaborates with the
    operators to plan strategies and inspires his allies with his military fan,
    which can inflame the morale of the troops, to lead the team to victory
  BIO_H02: |-
    In his mind, he was constantly torn between the frustration of not being able to
    go out into the field as he was usually in the command center giving orders, and
    the fear that he would be a burden to the heroes on his side by joining the
    ranks after being out of the field for so long. Although he may seem frivolous,
    he has a strong sense of responsibility, and he chooses to take a step back,
    biting back the frustration. When he stands on the battlefield, how the battle
    situation will move...even he himself does not know.

    A middle-aged man who works for the administrative department of the General
    Affairs Bureau of Orient City's City Hall and also serves as the general
    commander of the UEHA Japan branch. An earthling from Osaka, Japan, his full
    name is Takadono Okitaka. With his cheerful and sociable personality and affable
    manner, he doesn't come across like a person in a key internal management
    position, but his wisdom as a commander is outstanding. The tight-knit working
    relationship between UEHA and Parallel Flight is due to the fact that he, Ryekie
    and Huckle formed a deep bond after a joint battle.
