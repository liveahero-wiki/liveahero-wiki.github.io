    They all share the belief that if there's money involved, the job will be done
    no matter what, but they also understand that technology is of utmost importance
    for the trust of their employers.

    For that reason, they have mastered various different weapons and have earned
    their success.

    They are able to hide with the active camouflage their mantles provide, and
    shoot from very long distances with their parallel weapon - the laser rifle.

    As for those that manage to get close - they have a knife on the tip of their
    tail that they can cut their enemies with.

    After all, that is their only way to win their trust.

    They all seem to have belonged to a military organization of sorts, albeit all
    believing that they don't need to talk about the past.

    They've survived a vast number of battles, and while some are more strategic
    while others are more warlike in personality, they all share one thing in
    common, which is that during a battle, they will always be thoroughly prepared.

    They are aware that even small information leaks, as well as small mistakes can
    mean certain death.

    For that reason, they have an unspoken agreement that showing their true face to
    someone is a sign of trust.
