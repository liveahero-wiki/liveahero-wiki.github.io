    He transforms into a bathhouse attendant and has a weapon that is made of fir
    and resembles a paddle or a sword. The paddle is clad in a water-like energy and
    the temperature of it increases by mixing the enthusiasm of his audience in the
    same way as a hot spring. The hotter the crowd, the hotter the edge of his
    weapon - it goes far beyond it's boiling point of 100 degrees Celsius. Although
    his power is remarkable, he has no knowledge in martial arts, which means that
    his movements are sloppy and he has a lot of weak spots.
  BIO_H02: |-
    He was hurt by thoughtless words, which made him close up his heart. What healed
    him were the hot springs of his parents' hometown and the people that lived
    there. It's not exaggerated to say that this hot spring town has made him grow
    to the point where he can work as the innkeeper. Therefore, he has more than
    gratitude to the city, and he became a hero in order to protect it from peace-
    threatening beings. As long as his beloved city continues to develop as a
    tourist destination, his dream will never stop.

    In order to get inspiration for a new event planned for the Inn, Nessen visited the traditional festival.
    What I saw there was people doing their best to liven up the festival for their own enjoyment.
    Nessen's new form to protect the people enjoying the party is wearing a hero suit reminiscent of the night sky.
    His parallel weapon, the ornament sewn into the suit, generates light that changes shape at will.
    The light becomes a dance partner that unites offense and defense, dancing on the battlefield with Nessen.
  BIO_H02: |-
    In the words of a clothing craftsman,
    "I don't know if my feelings will reach the other person, but I just put everything I have into it and give it a shape,"
    Nessen reexamines his own hospitality with that in mind. Even if you don't know for sure how your actions will be taken by others, you just continue to provide as best you can.
    Beyond that, there was a spirit of hospitality that Nessen was aiming for.
    Nessen's eyes shine like the night sky that gently welcomes the moon, as he looks ahead to the path he is aiming for with determination.

  BIO_S01: |-
    A man who manages both a hot spring resort in the southern part of Orient City
    and one of the hot spring inns located there. Born in Shizuoka, Japan, his full
    name is Mochizuki Nessen. He is half earthling, half alien.  He has a stern
    expression on his face, his body is rugged and he has 2 sharp horns, due to
    which people are oftentimes scared of him when they meet for the first time. He
    is a gentle person with a soft demeanor, but he has a strong sense of
    responsibility. He loves taking baths and does so about 5 times a day.
