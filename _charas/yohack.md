  BIO_H01: |-
    Yohack wears a jumpsuit-style hero suit that resembles that of the locksmith who once saved him.
    His parallel weapon is a master key that embodies his desire to rescue trapped people.
    This key, which can be used with any lock, also has the function of unlocking the subject's mind as if it were a locked door.
    By applying it, it is possible to draw out the potential of allied heroes and support them.
    By opening what Yohack perceives as the "door of the mind," he can learn things of the subject that they would not normally say,
    but Yohack does not like to use this aspect of his power if it can be helped, seeing it as stepping into the heart of another person uninvited.
  BIO_H02: |-
    When Yohack was a child, he was trapped in a room in a spaceship in the aftermath of the Kaibutsu disaster.
    The door key was destroyed and the door could not be opened from the inside.
    The man who called out to the frightened and trembling Yohack claimed to be a locksmith.
    Encouraging Yohack as he worked, the man successfully unlocked the door to freedom.
    Stricken with admiration, Yohack moved alone to Muirauka IV when he came of age, where the man had a shop, and studied as a locksmith under him.
    To show those in need that there is a way out, and to rescue them.
