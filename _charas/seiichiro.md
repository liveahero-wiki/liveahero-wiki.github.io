    An observer who serves as the chief operator of UEHA japan branch, also the
    Parliamentary Secretary at the Ministry of Regional Defense.

    Born in Sakai, Japan, his full name is Seiichiro Tenma.

    A confident man who boasts of his advantages: sharp mind, handsome, athletic,
    and comes from a prominent family.

    Often being shunned in the ministry due to his unyielding and unforgiving
    attitude towards injustice.

    Okitaka likes him due to His peerless ability to listen, compiling information
    from others, and lead the team.

    Since his awakening as an "observer" at an early age, it was his overwhelming
    confidence and high pride that protected him from the inquisitive looks of those
    around him.

    A resolute attitude against irrationality, he overwrite discrimination with his
    charisma and competence.

    His somewhat narcissistic attitude is a testament to his life of resisting
    external pressure.

    The bizarre rebellious spirit is also directed at the intervenors, and he
    continues to work in his underground organization to achieve revenge against
    them.
