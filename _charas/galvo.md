    He is a hero who fight surrounded by a pale blue flame, with crystallized arms and legs.
  
    This is a figure that represents the accomplished self of Galvo's dream, and the cloth he wears is the special garb of his tribe.
  
    Every time he fully wields the ferocity and aggression of his original race, which he does not usually display,
    using his limbs and flames, his limbs and flames gleam more and more.
  
    The dazzle seems to be Galvo's own pride and joy.
