  BIO_H01: |-
    He dreams of grasping a glorious future with his hand, and his parallel weapon
    is an equipment that can reproduce \[The Future\] in his hands.

    By accessing the brain of his future self, which has succeeded in reaching the
    cutting edge of the entire universe,

    he can output things on his glove that cannot be created with modern technology
    and can be used as a weapon.

    These weapons, made up of unknown technology that can only be described as the
    product of magic, foreshadow the infinite development of science and technology.
  BIO_H02: |-
    He is proud of himself as a genius and acts confidently, asserting
    straightforwardly his desires for self-expression and approval, desires that are
    often perceived in a negative light.

    This personality was shaped by his defiance against the people around him who
    kept pointing at him as a \[fake\] and his desire to make them recognize his
    existence.

    Wishing to assert his existence and be recognized by as many people as possible
    .....he continues to search for the development of cutting-edge technology that
    will surprise everyone.

  BIO_H01: |-
    Hisaki has taken on a new form through guarding the underwater ruins on the
    planet Sama'ad.

    The robot that takes the appearance of a fish acts independently to protect
    Hisaki, and also assists him in battle by creating a small bubble of protection
    when he is attacked by enemies.

    As an inventor, Hisaki devoted himself to previously unheard of technology.

    The result is a single person and a single machine that move together as one
    underwater as if they have a heart-to-heart communication.
  BIO_H02: |-
    The life's work that another Hisaki completed in the parallel universe this
    power draws from was a new "way of life" in which both organics and robots could
    live in harmony with each other.

    It is precisely because Hisaki has a history of misuse of the technology he
    invented that he was able to realize the nature of the bond between human and
    machines.

    What is it that he really wants to create, what kind of relationship can be
    built between humans and robots, and how should technology be utilized? The
    flame of his passion will never burn out.

  BIO_S01: |-
    A young man working at a medium sized factory of a heavy industry equipment
    manufacturer.

    He looks like a beast-man alien, but because he was adopted by a Japanese
    family, his full name is Yodobashi Hisaki.

    He has a wide range of knowledge about science and engineering, and is a genius
    inventor as recognized by himself and his peers alike.

    He is usually devoted to developing suspicious "new products" in his personal
    laboratory in a secluded corner of the factory.

    He is a self-confident person with a sociable and cheerful personality, but at
    the same time he is quite sloppy.

    He calls his college senior Crowne his big sis, and both trusts and lives in
    fear of her at the same time.
