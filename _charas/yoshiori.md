    When he was a soldier, he was feared by his enemies and revered by his allies.

    This was a time when Yoshiori's existence was most recognized by others.

    He wants to "reclaim his existence," and as such he transforms into a villain
    clad in armaments that reflects his memories of that time.  He has regained his
    right arm and abdomen, which were digested by Kaibutsu,

    and from his abdomen, which is connected to another space, he can take out
    various weapons that he has handled before.

    His favorite weapon seems to be a machine gun.
  BIO_H02: |-
    One day on the battlefield, Yoshiori was eaten by Kaibutsu and was freed in a
    partially digested state, turning him into "a person who never existed".

    He disappeared from the memories of his parents, siblings, and friends, and from
    his family register and records.

    Normal people can't see him, touch him, or hear his voice.

    In his desperate loneliness, Yoshiori vows to reclaim his existence by any means
    necessary.

    Today, he fights to have his existence recognized by the people he loves again.

  BIO_H01: |-
    Yoshiori gained a new look on his journey on the luxurious galactic mystery train.
    
    His parallel weapon is transformed into twin revolver which is used to protect the passenger, 
    and a sunglasses with the capability to detect and project any possible danger in the surroundings, 
    It represent a belief in protection while still maintaining Yoshiori's style in eliminating his enemies.
    
    The high mobility of the hero suit is adapted for assault, 
    while the though physical and mental endurance allowed him to protect his target and sacrifice himself if necessary.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Being unrecognized for most people, Yoshiori sometimes feel like as if he's a ghost.
    
    The dreams he hold when he's still a child, the days when he trains himself desperately all the time to reach that…
    
    that kind of dreams will never come true now, was what he used as an excuse, 
    but now he threw it away and wish for once more to be able to protect someone.
    
    As a security professional (SP), even with his vanished arm, 
    he will still appear in front of any threat and put his life on the line against it.

  BIO_S01: |-
    An earthling villain whose duty is to act as the bodyguard of Exio.

    He originally used to be an excellent soldier of the special ops unit of the
    United Earth's forces.

    After having been almost digested by kaibutsu however, he can only be perceived
    by heroes and observers.

    Despite a wild personality like his appearance suggest, towards those he approve
    of, he possess doglike loyalty and is thoroughly obedient.

    He feels a strong debt of gratitude towards Exio.
