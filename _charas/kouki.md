    As two heroes, they transform into heroic entertainers wearing matching gorgeous
    costumes. The appearance that grabs the viewer's attention, and their flashy
    battle technique makes them stand out as heroes. Behind the unrivaled
    performance meant for gathering all eyes to them on the battlefield lies a
    "purpose" that they pursue.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Kouki continues to chase after the mother who disappeared from his life.
    Becoming an actor and, with special approval, becoming a hero are all done in
    the name of "if I become a big star, she'll find me." However,  despite the many
    achievements he has under his belt, his mother has yet to appear. It was his
    partner Sirius who became a hero with the desire to "always stay with Kouki",
    always snuggling up to Kouki when he becomes anxious.

    Citizens look forward to the festival. 
    The hero suit called by him through parallel queue is for the sake of opposing the existence that threaten them.
    Based on traditional costumes, it was created with both functionality and design, satisfying Kouki's high level of professionalism.
    Even though it's the first time for him, he is a professional who says it is his job to charm people under any conditions,
    so, together with Sirius he set off with their clapper shaped blade parallel weapon.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Kouki himself is actually troubled by his future prospect.
    When growing up should he continue his good boy persona, will the audience accepts his real personality…
    watching him searching for answer is his family Sirius who always snuggling up to him, never changing.
    If Kouki, dressed in a glamorous tailcoat-like clothing, is the protecting figure, he is the offensive figure standing on the battlefield in festive attire.
    Believing that one day the wish he held in his heart will come true, he paves the way to the future.

  BIO_S01: |-
    A duo of a child actor and a talented dog who display a wide range of activites
    centered on global video media.

    Both originate from Nagoya, Japan. Their full names are Kouki Inukura and
    Sirius, respectively.

    Kouki has risen as a first-class actor thanks to his talent as a performer,
    acknowledged and esteemed by peers in the field. Because of that, his
    personality differs depending on wheter there is a presence or an absence of a
    camera. When a camera is recording he acts as a meek good kid. The second the
    cameras are off however he lays bare his haugthy and arrogant demeanour. The
    driving force behind his doings seems to be the existence of a long-lost mother.

## Notes

- His full name is Inukura Kouki (犬座 コウキ)
- [Sirius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius) is the brightest star in the night sky, designated as Alpha canis Majoris, the name is derived from the Greek word Σείριος (Seirios, lit "Shining One")
  - Kouki is presumably from japanese word 光輝 (Kouki) which means brightness/splendor.
  - Sirius looks like a single star for the naked eye, but it's actually a [binary star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_star) with another smaller star at its side
