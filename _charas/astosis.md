    A hero of law and judgment has appeared in S&S Heroes, and that hero is
    Astosis.

    The moment Astosis appears, bearing his hero suit, the battlefield will be
    seized upon, and transform into a sanctuary of trial and judgment.

    Each time Astosis wields his Parallel Weapon, a staff adorned with the
    scales of justice, a light that seems to be the very embodiment of poetic
    justice would rain down, for all evil will be condemned, and its existence
    unforgiven.

    He himself humbly smiles and states, "The judgment of good and evil is based
    on my own subjectivity, so it has little effect on those who have not
    committed a clear crime. I must pick and choose when to use it."

    Yet, there are no doubt that enemies would feel terror at that very smile.
  5th_anniversary_true_self: |-
    Astosis is also active as a freelance lawyer. He has won the trust of
    many clients with his prompt, yet meticulous work and his excellent
    communication skills.

    He is often called upon to handle legal affairs for S&S Heroes, and
    has apparently had many other heroes during meetings with different
    organizations.

    Due to these circumstances, it was thought that he had few
    opportunities to interact with fans. However, he surprised viewers by
    appearing as a guest hero in a show at a hotel in Tesfinito, the
    entertainment city of Muirauka III.

    In a subsequent interview, he himself said with a smile that he wants
    to create as many opportunities to interact with fans as his schedule
    permits, and so the fan community is now buzzing with excitement.

  BIO_H01: |-
    Dressed in his hero suit, Astosis wields a parallel weapon in the form of a staff with scales at the end.
    Embodying his vision of good and evil, the scale has different effects depending on what side it leans to.
    Specifically, immense power will be used against those who should be punished, and strong support will be given to those who should be praised.
    However, the judgment of right and wrong depends on Astosis' personal assessment.
    As such, when he is unsure of his judgment, the scale cannot show its true value.
  BIO_H02: |-
    His father was a brilliant lawyer. Astosis grew up admiring him, the way he always fought for a fair verdict, saving many clients.
    As an adult, he decided to follow in those footsteps and become a lawyer himself.
    After extraordinary efforts, he completed his bar exam and studied under his father, whom he respected the most.
    However, his harsh but fulfilling days came to an abrupt end with his father's suicide.
    Left alone, Astosis still refuses to let go of his badge, the sign of a lawyer. With a firm conviction in his heart, he enters the courtroom.

  BIO_S01: |-
    A lion beastman alien who works as a freelance lawyer. His work is quick and courteous, and he is highly regarded by his clients.
    He also has good communication skills, so he is good at quickly winning the trust of his clients and gaining the information necessary for his defense.
    On the other hand, Astosis is reluctant to talk much about himself.
    He's unexpectedly touchy-feely upon greeting new people despite his withdrawn nature, but there seems to be another reason for this act.
