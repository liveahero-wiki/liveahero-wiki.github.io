  BIO_H01: |-
    Dressed in his hero suit, Astosis wields a parallel weapon in the form of a staff with scales at the end.
    Embodying his vision of good and evil, the scale has different effects depending on what side it leans to.
    Specifically, immense power will be used against those who should be punished, and strong support will be given to those who should be praised.
    However, the judgment of right and wrong depends on Astosis' personal assessment.
    As such, when he is unsure of his judgment, the scale cannot show its true value.
  BIO_H02: |-
    His father was a brilliant lawyer. Astosis grew up admiring him, the way he always fought for a fair verdict, saving many clients.
    As an adult, he decided to follow in those footsteps and become a lawyer himself.
    After extraordinary efforts, he completed his bar exam and studied under his father, whom he respected the most.
    However, his harsh but fulfilling days came to an abrupt end with his father's suicide.
    Left alone, Astosis still refuses to let go of his badge, the sign of a lawyer. With a firm conviction in his heart, he enters the courtroom.

  BIO_S01: |-
    A lion beastman alien who works as a freelance lawyer. His work is quick and courteous, and he is highly regarded by his clients.
    He also has good communication skills, so he is good at quickly winning the trust of his clients and gaining the information necessary for his defense.
    On the other hand, Astosis is reluctant to talk much about himself.
    He's unexpectedly touchy-feely upon greeting new people despite his withdrawn nature, but there seems to be another reason for this act.
