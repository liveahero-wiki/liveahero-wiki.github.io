    Do not underestimate the rookie hero "Canes" as just some newcomer. He is a
    powerhouse who defeated a large-scale Kaibutsu in his very first battle right
    after awakening his powers!

    He freely manipulates his Parallel Weapon, a set of giant arms, as if it
    were a part of his own body, switching between offense, cover, and support
    to match the flow of battle. It is said these giant arms can even be
    switched to an autonomous mode to protect his companions.

    However, his greatest assets are his insight and quick-wittedness. His style of
    fighting, by observing his target, waiting for an opportunity, then finishing
    them with a single strike from their blind spot, is exactly like that of a
    hunter.

    At times, he will even act as a decoy to assist his allies.

    Be sure to check out the feats of this promising new hero, who combines both
    caution and boldness, on Hero Live!
  5th_anniversary_true_self: |-
    In planetary colonization, there are cases where development and
    settlement proceed while terraforming is avoided, to preserve the
    original environment as much as possible. This is where Space Hunters
    come in. They descend to the planet alongside the pioneers to subjugate
    creatures that pose a threat to humans and to protect the residential
    areas. It is also their duty to devise and propose methods for use of the
    creatures that they hunt as raw materials.

    Canes is currently undertaking missions in Muirauka I alongside his
    family and fellow hunters. It seems that, just like with his hero work,
    he is still a novice here... but it is said that the veteran hunters around
    him have high hopes for the future of him and his sibling.

    He himself is very humble and has a tendency to underestimate his
    own abilities. However, his physical prowess is exceptionally high;
    if Canes were to compete in sports against students his age on Earth,
    he would surely triumph in every event. When we mentioned this to
    him, he refused to believe it. It seems that because the abilities of his
    family and companions he lives with are so immense, he has no real
    grasp of his own potential....
