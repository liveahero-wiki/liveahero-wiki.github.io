  BIO_S01: |-
    An observer girl who lives with Exio. She is an earthling with an unknown
    nationality.

    Since her powers of an observer were awakened very early into childhood, she is
    very good at handling them and her prowess are beyond that of Exio when it comes
    to meddling with the parallel universe.

    As a very quiet and timid person, she rarely ever shows the ups and downs of her
    emotions.

    So that her surroundings will continue to call her a "Witch", she take in that
    name and now collects that kind of goods deliberately.

    Because of her frail body, when she goes out, Monomasa oftentimes accompanies
    her as a bodyguard.

    Her childhood was miserable, as her witch abilities were awakened during her
    formative years.

    She was frowned upon, feared, persecuted, and abused.

    In the end, she was left behind in a kaibutsu attack.

    Her emotions had disappeared to the point where she forgot how to even cry, and
    it was Exio, who had the same abilities as her, who came to her rescue.

    From Exio, she received the love that her parents could not give her.

    The reason why she decided to live as a witch was to repay her debt to Exio.
