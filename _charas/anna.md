    Her hero suit itself functions as a parallel weapon.<br>
    The fluttering flared skirt and veil are overflowing with energy and have the effect of 
    energizing those around her in response to her desire to be liberated.<br>
    The contemporary dance that she perform can be calming or invigorating, the effect changes depending on the person who see it.<br>
    However, Anna takes this as a matter of course.<br> 
    She believes that each person has a different need to liberate their own feelings.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Anna was inspired by the dancers she saw at first sight.<br>
    She began to self-learn how to dance, and it didn't take long for her to get the hang of it.<br>
    However, her father, who is a firm believer in a better and stable life, and Anna, who is a dreamer and runs after her dreams, 
    clash in their different ways of thinking, leading to a huge fight that makes her ran out of the house.<br>
    Anna wants to bring dance to people who have been suppressed and tell them that it is okay to be free.<br>
    She also hoped that one day her father would understand. This is her secret wish, almost like a prayer.

  BIO_S01: |-
    Her real name is Anna Meidou.<br> 
    She attends the high school of the Sakuramoto private  academy, 
    where she aspires to become a professional dancer and actively participates in the activities of the dance club.<br>
    She is curious, somewhat impatient, and not afraid of things, traveling with her body to unfamiliar planets and cities.<br>
    She often demonstrates a fatal lack of sense of direction by walking around without looking at a map and eventually getting lost.<br>
    On the other hand, her open and honest manner of speaking makes her popular among her classmates, 
    regardless of gender, race, or personality, as she is easy to talk to.
