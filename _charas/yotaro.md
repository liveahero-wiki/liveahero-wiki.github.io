  BIO_S01: |-
    On the surface, he is a young entrepreneur running an antique shop, but beneath that facade, he operates as a villain Observer,           skilled in navigating the dark web.

    He excels in handling numbers and information, adept at reading atmospheres and trends, and possesses a clever way with words.
    He makes a living off his innate business acumen, but much of his earnings are spent on repairs caused by Gaisei's destructive            tendencies, leaving him frustrated with his inability to save money.
    There are also rumors that he sells the spoils collected by Gaisei to dubious scientists.
  
    Yotaro has a unique ability to perceive information about others through taste and smell, claiming he can discern their essence.
    However, awakening this power drastically changed his life, as he was expected to be the heir of a powerful conglomerate.
    While he tries to maintain an appearance of normalcy and hide his abilities, his mental state deteriorates under the pressure.

    When a Kaibutsu attack reveals his identity as an Observer to his relatives, he impulsively leaves home and begins living as a            villain.
    Despite describing Gaisei as a "violent and outrageous guy," he finds comfort in their mutually carefree relationship.
