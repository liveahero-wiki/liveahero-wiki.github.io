    From the moment this hero in a flashy suit appears the scene become his stage! Roudin, the magician hero of S&S Heroes, wields a cane and silk top hat—his Parallel Weapons—to perform spectacular, mind-bending magic. Though technically a combat, his battles captivate audiences like an entertainment show, holding their gaze from start to finish.

    At first glance, Roudin’s fighting style may seem like it’s all show. But every magic trick, every gesture, even the direction of his gaze is meticulously calculated to command attention.
    
    This mastery stems from years of experience and dedication as a stage magician since childhood. The gap between his flamboyant behavior and hardworking nature is part of what draws so many fans to him.

    By the way, the little “partner” who peeks out from his silk hat has developed a niche fanbase of their own—and yes, there’s even a secret line of merchandise!

    From massive event stages to wedding receptions, Roudin—the popular stage magician—cheerfully accepts any performance request that comes his way.
    
    However, out of respect for his second profession as a hotelier, which he’s equally committed to, most of his schedule is fully booked with performances in Tesfinit, the largest entertainment city on Muirauka III, which also serves as his home base.

    If you want to see Roudin perform live up close, your best bet is to join one of the Tesfinit tours offered in partnership with S&S Heroes. These exclusive packages often include stage tickets and even private meet-and-greet sessions with Rudin himself.

    Having returned to the spotlight after a long hiatus, Roudin has reclaimed his place as a fan-favorite magician.
    Despite his flamboyant appearance and friendly personality, his private life is surprisingly disciplined. He reportedly spends nearly all his free time practicing magic, with the occasional street snack being his only indulgence.

    When a reporter asked why he doesn’t enjoy Tesfinit’s vibrant bars or casinos, he replied with a vague smile:
    “I used to hang out in those places way too much when I was younger... got my fill back then.”
