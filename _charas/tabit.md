  BIO_S01: |-
    A former military man who was the commander of a special operations unit in an interstellar war,
    he puts his fellow soldiers who fought with him first.
    
    He is also a chivalrous man and never forgets a favor he once received.
    
    He and his friends wandered around various stars in an attempt to return to his birth planet, 
    which he lose connection with due to the war.
    
    Although he does not seem to be too concerned about it, 
    there seems to be a reason for the abnormality in some of his language functions.
