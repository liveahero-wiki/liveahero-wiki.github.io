    He transforms into "Polaris the Great," a hero wearing a costume that is a
    little more flashy than his usual costume. He fights using a parallel weapon in
    the form of his shoes that has the ability to control gravity. By intentionally
    creating a battlefield that puts a heavy load on both himself and his enemies,
    he forces his enemy to partake in a "serious battle" with him
  BIO_H02: |-
    His special Move is "Fighting Spirit - Polaris Buster". In a gravitational field
    that is completely different from the earth, such as high gravity and low
    gravity, he uses a deadly flying technique against the enemy by maximizing his
    strength and fighting ability. Even under high gravity, where his body is likely
    to be crushed, he laughs invincibly while flexing his muscles, and shows off the
    best extreme battle that the audience wants to see. All to prepare for his dream
    of "confrontation with the strongest man in the universe".

  BIO_S01: |-
    A masked professional wrestler who wanders through the universe.

    An earthling originating from Sapporo, Japan. His real name is Kensuke Kitakami.

    Once a champion who climbed to the very top of the world professional wrestling
    on Earth, he became unsatisfied with that title alone, and so he embarked towads
    wider galaxies in hopes of facing fiercer opponents.

    Because his positive thinking and excitement are always off-charts, all of his
    actions and decisions are impulsive and without second thought.

    He has a tendency of being in the midst of big-sized tussles, so he is a man who
    is both a hero and a troublemaker.
