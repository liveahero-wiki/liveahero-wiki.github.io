He transforms into "Polaris the Great," a hero wearing a costume that is a little more flashy than his usual costume. He fights using a parallel weapon in the form of his shoes that has the ability to control gravity. By intentionally creating a battlefield that puts a heavy load on both himself and his enemies, he forces his enemy to partake in a "serious battle" with him

His special Move is "Fighting Spirit - Polaris Buster". In a gravitational field that is completely different from the earth, such as high gravity and low gravity, he uses a deadly flying technique against the enemy by maximizing his strength and fighting ability. Even under high gravity, where his body is likely to be crushed, he laughs invincibly while flexing his muscles, and shows off the best extreme battle that the audience wants to see. All to prepare for his dream of "confrontation with the strongest man in the universe".

A masked professional wrestler who wanders through the universe.

An earthling originating from Sapporo, Japan. His real name is Kensuke Kitakami.

Once a champion who climbed to the very top of the world professional wrestling on Earth, he became unsatisfied with that title alone, and so he embarked towads wider galaxies in hopes of facing fiercer opponents.

Because his positive thinking and excitement are always off-charts, all of his actions and decisions are impulsive and without second thought.

He has a tendency of being in the midst of big-sized tussles, so he is a man who is both a hero and a troublemaker.
