    He transforms into a form equipped with armor that can withstand space debris and a parallel weapon featuring anti-gravity modules.       Gravity generators are installed on the chest, arms, and legs, allowing Orbiter to move freely even in low-gravity or zero-gravity        environments by manipulating gravitational fields.

    Additionally, by increasing the output of gravity manipulation at specific coordinates, they can attract or fix objects in place.
    This capability stems from Orbiter’s desire to "freely soar through space," reflecting their pure and straightforward enthusiasm for      adventure.

    He is a boy with a strong fascination for space, dreaming of adventuring through the vastness of the cosmos.
    Despite his giant appearance, he has an innocent and curious personality, with his facial expressions on the face display changing        rapidly.

    He always wears a spacesuit designed for extravehicular activities, showing a strong resistance to removing it.
    Aspiring to be an astronaut, he often goes out under the guise of training and information gathering, turning his walks and playtime      into opportunities for exploration.
