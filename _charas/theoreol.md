    Theoreol has incorporated numerous objects into his body over the years.
    The absorbed and melted substances accumulate in Theoreol's body as information and are used as material for alchemy.
    The  laboratory equipment parallel weapon used by Theoreol optimizes various processes in alchemy to their utmost limit.
    By using this parallel weapon, Theoreol can instantly generate various substances he knows the chemical composition of according to       the situation.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Theoreol calls himself "a failure." It is because the alchemist who created him  declared him so.
    An "imperfect" specimen. Why did the Creator forge such a failure, and what is the significance of his existence as an imperfect life?
    The alchemist's ideal that his Creator aimed for at the end of his research, the creation of the "philosopher's stone" is his symbol      of perfection.
    If he could succeed in creating it, will he understand the purpose of his existence? To prove his hypothesis,
    Theoreol has been studying alchemy alone for many, many years.

  BIO_S01: |-
    Theoriol wears clothing that covers his entire body, as well as a unique mask that hides his face.
    Most people do a double take when they see such an odd alchemist like him for the first time.
    He is a homunculus, whose slime-like body was created by an alchemist on a ruined planet.

    He has lived for a very long time, and even after the destruction of his planet, he continues to wander on his own and study alchemy.     He has little interest in anything outside of alchemy, and because of that,
    he has made very little contact with people, making his knowledge of common courtesy very lacking.
