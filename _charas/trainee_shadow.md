    There are many scenes where alien heroes are active on Earth, and heroes with
    high fame are usually aliens born with high physical abilities.

    As earthlings, they are aware that they do not have such unique physical
    abilities.

    However, they believe that there are things only they can protect and confront
    because they were born and raised on the earth.

    With strong beliefs, they train hard everyday, and occasionally demonstrate
    their ability to defeat even such physically capable aliens.
sidekicks:

  BIO_S01: |-
    Earthling heroes that become heroes to protect Earth.

    With strong awareness of their identity as heroes, they don't let go of their
    helmet even when off duty.

    After their work or on holiday, they are usually training in the neighborhood
    sports gym or a hero training facility.

    Maybe because the culture of heroes are brought by aliens, they hold high
    admiration towards them, and their helmet and outfit are designed based on
    aliens.
