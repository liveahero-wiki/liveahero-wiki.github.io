Marfik transforms into a hero by dressing up with an adventurer-like appearance while handling two types of parallel weapons, a pickaxe and a rope. When he hits the ground with his pickaxe, he has the ability to evoke the "memory of the stars" that sleep deep within the stratum of the earth, and the rope can pull out the energy that embodies that memory and use it for attacks. However, he can only keep this power for a short time, usually just a few minutes.

Archeologist enrolled in university, and an adventure-lover for as long as he remembers. An Earthling from Indianapolis, USA. Having vitality and toughness far from any ordinary person, he's a mischievous man in the prime of his life, who possesses both the composure and thinking power of a scholar, and the curiosity of a child.

He is interested in ancient civilizations from all sorts of planets, even the ones at the ends of the universe. It is said that if there is a place with rare ruins to explore, he will be there. On the other hand, he holds no interest whatsoever in the monetary value of the goods he digs out.
