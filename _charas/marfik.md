    Marfik transforms into a hero by dressing up with an adventurer-like appearance
    while handling two types of parallel weapons, a pickaxe and a rope.

    When he hits the ground with his pickaxe, he has the ability to evoke the
    "memory of the stars" that sleep deep within the stratum of the earth, and the
    rope can pull out the energy that embodies that memory and use it for attacks.

    However, he can only keep this power for a short time, usually just a few
    minutes.
  BIO_H02: |-
    The supreme theory of life in Marfik's mind, who has an immense curiosity for
    such things, is "to know the mystery of space life".

    He wishes to leave himself to the spirit of inquiry, to go where he wants to go,
    to do what he wants to do, and to know what he wants to know.

    Because of that, he always ends up breaking up with the partners he loves.

    If such an existence that occupies his unyielding obsession appears, it will be
    an existence full of mystery.

  BIO_H01: |-
    After challenging a labyrinth full of puzzles and mystery, Marfik's curiosity
    couldn't stay in 1 place and thus, Marfik gained a new hero form.

    Optimized for adventures deep within said labyrinth, he is now equipped with a
    number of exploratory tools and a parallel weapon that can turn into a sword and
    a shovel.

    It is a costume fitting for Marfik's status, as someone who has been an
    adventurer for his entire life.

    However, he deemed the small amount/lack of fabrics a little too adventurous for
    him.

    Hearing about the labyrinth that only heroes and observers could interact with,
    he immediately set sail on his adventure.
  BIO_H02: |-
    A certain limit has been approaching for Marfik, who has traveled all around the
    universe to fulfill his childhood dream of being an "adventurer".

    That limit is "age", the force that no one can resist.

    The driving force behind this man, who feels his old age but never stops
    adventuring, is his curiosity and desire for knowledge.

    He will continue to be a hero and an adventurer as long as the endless fountain
    of the mind continues to spring up.

  BIO_S01: |-
    Archeologist enrolled in university, and an adventure-lover for as long as he
    remembers.

    An Earthling from Indianapolis, USA.

    Having vitality and toughness far from any ordinary person, he's a mischievous
    man in the prime of his life, who possesses both the composure and thinking
    power of a scholar, and the curiosity of a child.

    He is interested in ancient civilizations from all sorts of planets, even the
    ones at the ends of the universe.

    It is said that if there is a place with rare ruins to explore, he will be
    there.

    On the other hand, he holds no interest whatsoever in the monetary value of the
    goods he digs out.
