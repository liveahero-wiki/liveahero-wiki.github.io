    His weapon of choice is a parallel weapon in the form of four mechanical
    tentacles extending from his back.<br>These tentacles, born from his idea that
    he "needs more hands to produce a perfect invention," can move as naturally as
    physical appendages.<br>The tips of the tentacles are equipped with a mechanism
    that allows them to emit three-pronged claws and lasers, which they use in
    combat.<br>The tips of the arms are flexible and can be transformed into
    whatever shape he needs at any given moment.

    was so upset and frustrated that no one remembered him that he set his sights on
    becoming "an inventor that will never be forgotten.<br>The driving force that
    keeps him going with his inventions, despite his daily screw-ups and repeated
    failures, is the unforgettable frustration that he felt at that time.
