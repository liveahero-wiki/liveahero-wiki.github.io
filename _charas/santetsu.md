His quirk of having an unusual strong interest and knowledge of books is probably reflected in his abilities as a hero.

By creating an "index" with arbitrary conditions, it is possible to manipulate space-time and events, such as replacing the actions of an opponent or ally. 

In addition, by embodying a book read in the past based on memory and "quoting" a sentence from it, he can reflect the event in reality as per the extracted sentence.

But, he need to close his eyes, concentrate, and not move to use it.
