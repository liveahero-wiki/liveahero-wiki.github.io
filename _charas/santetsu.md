  5th_anniversary_intro: |-
    Santetsu, a hero who holds the alias "Guardian of the Library", fights by
    drawing out the power of books etched into his memory. Having read a
    tremendous number of books, he can materialize the most appropriate one for
    any given situation.
    
    As Santetsu dislikes wastefulness, he always strives to use his abilities with
    maximum efficiency, ensuring that his live streams never drag on.

    May he be typically rational and calm, Santetsu would reveal a raging wrath
    towards any villain who would dare damage a library or its books.

    It is said that he uses the materialized books to generate various phenomena
    and thoroughly sets on "rehabilitating" his opponents.

    Incidentally, as he is the type of hero who doesn't often take the main stage,
    any battle live stream in which he appears is apparently shared instantly among
    his fans.
  5th_anniversary_true_self: |-
    Santetsu, who works at the New National Library in Osaka, is arguably
    one of the most prolific readers in all of Japan. His knowledge, which
    can be described as that of a living dictionary, is backed by an
    immense volume of reading and a unique mnemonic ability.

    He claims to remember nearly the entire contents of every book he has
    read once, and is able to recite from it simply by being told its title
    and a page number.

    Because of these special skills, Santetsu is highly valued by various
    organizations, but he apparently turns down many long-distance
    offers on the grounds that he would cut into his reading time.

    Furthermore, while there seems to be a complex history behind how
    he acquired these abilities, we were unable to ask him about it in
    this interview.

    Incidentally, while Santetsu's hero activities remain modest, he is
    said to be an incredibly reliable and highly valued presence at the
    New National Library where he works.

  BIO_H01: |-
    His quirk of having an unusual strong interest and knowledge of books is
    probably reflected in his abilities as a hero.

    By creating an "index" with arbitrary conditions, it is possible to manipulate
    space-time and events, such as replacing the actions of an opponent or ally.

    In addition, by embodying a book read in the past based on memory and "quoting"
    a sentence from it, he can reflect the event in reality as per the extracted
    sentence.

    But, he need to close his eyes, concentrate, and not move to use it.
  BIO_H02: |-
    For him, who had been alone in his family since childhood, books were his
    salvation and his life itself.

    Therefore, he became a hero with a wish to read every book that exists in the
    world.

    To protect all the precious books from people who have no idea of their value.

    With his love of books and his habit of reading each book to memory, he will
    eventually become a person with a knowledge base that no one else in the world
    can match.

    name is Santetsu Tokuhara.

    his unkempt hair and unshaven beard is a testament to his slothful nature.

    once, even remembering the contents of books that is no longer exist, making him
    quite valuable to various organization.
