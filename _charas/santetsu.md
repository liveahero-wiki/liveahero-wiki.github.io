    His quirk of having an unusual strong interest and knowledge of books is
    probably reflected in his abilities as a hero.

    By creating an "index" with arbitrary conditions, it is possible to manipulate
    space-time and events, such as replacing the actions of an opponent or ally.

    In addition, by embodying a book read in the past based on memory and "quoting"
    a sentence from it, he can reflect the event in reality as per the extracted
    sentence.

    But, he need to close his eyes, concentrate, and not move to use it.
  BIO_H02: |-
    For him, who had been alone in his family since childhood, books were his
    salvation and his life itself.

    Therefore, he became a hero with a wish to read every book that exists in the
    world.

    To protect all the precious books from people who have no idea of their value.

    With his love of books and his habit of reading each book to memory, he will
    eventually become a person with a knowledge base that no one else in the world
    can match.
