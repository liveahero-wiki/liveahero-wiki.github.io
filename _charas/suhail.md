    He transform into the villain "Captain Tronesion" to fight, with an artificial
    left arm. This arm was transplanted with parts left behind by a "friend" from
    the mechanical planet Tronesion. With a system built for fighting against
    kaibutsu, it can transform into various forms in response to Suhail's will. His
    favorite forms are the Magic Hand, which can extends endlessly towards its
    target, and the Energy Gun.

    For him, his left arm is a memento of a "friend" he once went through together
    but had disappeared. It's also a testament to his vow to "be the best pirate in
    the universe". No matter how many times he was arrested, he always escaped from
    prison. No matter how he was marked, he would stand at the front of his group
    and laugh boldly at the scene, but behind his unconventional way of life, He
    keeps striving to fulfill the promise he once made to his "friend", he is very
    sincere when it comes to friendships.

    The day Suhail landed on Tronesion, determined to become the best pirate in the universe, he encountered an inorganic life form, 
    and that was the day he met his one and only friend.<br>
    Memories of the past were awakened, and in response, 
    the parts of his left arm entrusted to him by his friend transformed into the form of a loudspeaker.<br>
    The suit, reminiscent of a cheering squad, interacted with the parallel weapon and became a voice that echoed far and wide.<br>
    The overlapping voices of the friends and Suhail shake the stars and sweep all the attention of the listeners.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Suhail, who lost part of his memory after being attacked by a Kaibutsu, goes back to his memory to try to remember what he lost.<br>
    He exchanged a promise with his friend, to become the best pirate in the universe, to steal all the attention, love and wealth.<br>
    He didn't forget...the day he met his friend, the day he made the pirate gang, the day he lost his left arm<br>
    It's because of this promise that Suhail can laugh heartily.<br>
    If you encourage the universe with all your might, then the universe will resonate and also encourage you back, this is what he learned from his friend.

    Sailing across the seven star systems, he is the leader of the space pirates,
    whose trademark is his artificial left arm. He is a chivalrous thief who steals
    money and goods from corrupt millionaires and rulers in order to give to the
    poor. Although not very intelligent, he is a man among men who possesses a big
    hearted personality capable of charming just about anybody. He is a hedonist who
    values the concept of "interesting" above all things, and deals only with
    targets and heroes that he deems as such. Despite not being registered as a hero
    and being classified as a villain capable of transforming, if there is an
    "interesting" mission on the table, he reaches out to Hero offices every now and
    then.
