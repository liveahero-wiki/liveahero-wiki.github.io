    For him, his left arm is a memento of a "friend" he once went through together
    but had disappeared. It's also a testament to his vow to "be the best pirate in
    the universe". No matter how many times he was arrested, he always escaped from
    prison. No matter how he was marked, he would stand at the front of his group
    and laugh boldly at the scene, but behind his unconventional way of life, He
    keeps striving to fulfill the promise he once made to his "friend", he is very
    sincere when it comes to friendships.

    Sailing across the seven star systems, he is the leader of the space pirates,
    whose trademark is his artificial left arm. He is a chivalrous thief who steals
    money and goods from corrupt millionaires and rulers in order to give to the
    poor. Although not very intelligent, he is a man among men who possesses a big
    hearted personality capable of charming just about anybody. He is a hedonist who
    values the concept of "interesting" above all things, and deals only with
    targets and heroes that he deems as such. Despite not being registered as a hero
    and being classified as a villain capable of transforming, if there is an
    "interesting" mission on the table, he reaches out to Hero offices every now and
    then.
