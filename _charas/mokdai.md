Transforms into a hero that combines his own image of a "cool hero" with a parallel weapon that can make the most of his abilities. The gloves and shoes he equips take his physical abilities to the limit, allowing him to jump high altitudes and use martial arts with outstanding destructive power. This equipment, which enhances his already formidable strength, is the perfect armament to make him a hero.

For Mokdai, who has a vast array of knowledge regarding heroes,  he himself was the furthest thing from his own ideal. From his appearance self evaluated as uncool, to the trauma of facing down countless kaibutsu, to worries of losing his nerve in the face of a horde, being a hero seemed like an unattainable dream. It was also the existence of that particular hero and operator that changed his mind.
