## Notes
- Vlaham's name may originate from the star Hamal, also known as Alpha Arietis, the brightest star on the constellation Aries and mixed with a reference to Van Helsing, a well known monster hunter in Western fiction.
- His Skill names are written in Latin:
  - Lumen Funeris - Funeral Light
  - Hostia Sphaerae - Sacrificial Sphere, can also be understood as "Offering to the World"
  - Memento Recte Mori - Remember to Die Justly, a play on the phrase "Memento Mori" or "Remember to Die" with the addition of "recte" meaning "correctly" or "justly"
