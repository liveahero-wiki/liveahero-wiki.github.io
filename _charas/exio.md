  BIO_S01: |-
    A mysterious "observer" who is a collaborator of Parallel Flight, Inc. Exio is
    an Earthling from Sydney, Australia, and his full name is Exio Grant.

    Ostensibly, he is a masseuse with a reputation for his excellent skills and
    gentle personality, but behind the scenes, he is a member of an underground
    organization that is working to complete a plan. He seems to harbor
    extraordinary hostility toward the "Broker".

    Even Melide, Yoshiori, and Monomasa, his closest allies, don't know much about
    his true purpose.

    However, everyone who is involved with him as a member of the underground
    organization knows that he knows more about the ambitions of the Broker than
    anyone else and is working to stop him.

    Those who come into contact with his life and learn his true intentions will
    learn about the position of "observers" in this world, how they are treated, and
    even how "observers" were born.
