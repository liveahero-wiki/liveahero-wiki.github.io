{% capture BIO_S01 %}
The founder and current president of the company where the Protagonist works at. He is a former hero, nowadays taking command on the battlefield as a hero operator. Despite being an alien from another world, he is completely acclimatized to life on Earth.

Even though he is an adult with an easygoing personality and a high sense of responsibility, he can be a bit absent-minded. He is also a worldly-wise man who puts himself in a position as a mentor of the free-spirited Ryekie. In order to command a hero, one must possess a "particular ability" to a relatively high level.

He was "Hopper The Faith", a S-class hero who once teamed up with Ryekie, aka Zap The Justice.
One day he suddenly awakened to the powers of an observer, and since then he could no longer transform into a hero, he decided to retire as a hero and put himself in a position to back them up.
His physique and good judgment on the battlefield can be attributed to this background.

## Notes:

"Hey now, don't overdo yourself over work. An operator must be ready at all times, you know? If something happens, it's my job to back you up."
