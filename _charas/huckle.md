    The most famous characteristics of the S-class hero "Hopper the Face" were his
    unbelievably high leg strength, the intricate footwork he could perform with his
    legs, and his outstandingly superior intellect.

    This has not changed even now that he has been reawakened.

    With his pure white cloak fluttering, he leaps high into the air, accelerates
    and descends in a single bound with a kick so powerful that even his partner Zap
    the Justice is amazed.

    He pretends to be ignorant of the fact that the weight he has put on since those
    days have made the attack even more potent.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Although he was born with strong legs, his upbringing has a lot to do with how
    he came to strengthen them and use them as a major feature in his arsenal.

    He was once a bird in a cage, not allowed to roam freely.

    This made him yearn for the outside world more and more, which led to his desire
    to "save the world and travel it with my own two feet".

    His parallel weapon, which amplifies the abilities of his legs and feet, and his
    costume, which is reminiscent of a traveler in old tales, are born from the
    longing of that child.

    The founder and current president of the company where the Protagonist works at.
    He is a former hero, nowadays taking command on the battlefield as a hero
    operator. Despite being an alien from another world, he is completely
    acclimatized to life on Earth.

    Even though he is an adult with an easygoing personality and a high sense of
    responsibility, he can be a bit absent-minded. He is also a worldly-wise man who
    puts himself in a position as a mentor of the free-spirited Ryekie. In order to
    command a hero, one must possess a "particular ability" to a relatively high
    level.

    He was "Hopper The Face", a S-class hero who once teamed up with Ryekie, aka Zap
    The Justice. One day he suddenly awakened to the powers of an observer, and
    since then he could no longer transform into a hero, he decided to retire as a
    hero and put himself in a position to back them up. His physique and good
    judgment on the battlefield can be attributed to this background.
