The most famous characteristics of the S-class hero "Hopper the Face" were his unbelievably high leg strength, the intricate footwork he could perform with his legs, and his outstandingly superior intellect. 

This has not changed even now that he has been reawakened. 

With his pure white cloak fluttering, he leaps high into the air, accelerates and descends in a single bound with a kick so powerful that even his partner Zap the Justice is amazed. 

He pretends to be ignorant of the fact that the weight he has put on since those days have made the attack even more potent.

Although he was born with strong legs, his upbringing has a lot to do with how he came to strengthen them and use them as a major feature in his arsenal.

He was once a bird in a cage, not allowed to roam freely. 

This made him yearn for the outside world more and more, which led to his desire to "save the world and travel it with my own two feet". 

His parallel weapon, which amplifies the abilities of his legs and feet, and his costume, which is reminiscent of a traveler in old tales, are born from the longing of that child.

The founder and current president of the company where the Protagonist works at. He is a former hero, nowadays taking command on the battlefield as a hero operator. Despite being an alien from another world, he is completely acclimatized to life on Earth.

Even though he is an adult with an easygoing personality and a high sense of responsibility, he can be a bit absent-minded. He is also a worldly-wise man who puts himself in a position as a mentor of the free-spirited Ryekie. In order to command a hero, one must possess a "particular ability" to a relatively high level.

He was "Hopper The Face", a S-class hero who once teamed up with Ryekie, aka Zap The Justice.
One day he suddenly awakened to the powers of an observer, and since then he could no longer transform into a hero, he decided to retire as a hero and put himself in a position to back them up.
His physique and good judgment on the battlefield can be attributed to this background.
