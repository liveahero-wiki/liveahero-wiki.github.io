    of rewriting the "flow" in a designated place. His parallel weapon, shaped like
    his favourite fountain pen, has the potential to alter the future with the
    condition that any changes made should fit naturally with the flow of the story,
    he can change the battle situation by writing on a floating manuscript. However,
    the weakness is that it is handwritten, so it takes time to write.
  BIO_H02: |-
    His desire is to write "The greatest masterpiece that approach the truth of
    reality", His creative spirit is based in the Kaibutsu attack that took place in
    his hometown. Each person who run about trying to escape has many bonds or loves

    Those are things one cannot experience by shutting themselves in a library

    Subaru is a novelist who lives and works in Orient city. He is an earthling from
    Japan who comes from Hamamatsu, with his full name and pen name being Nobeyama
    Subaru. With a slightly old-fashioned writing style and incredibly overwhelming
    story composition, he has managed to gather a certain fan base. His literary
    works consist a lot of humanity, but in actuality, he acts like an old man who
    is an unfriendly, jerky and sarcastic cynic.  He tends to dislike unnecessary
    outings and situations where he is disturbed by others, because it throws his
    life into disorder, which is why he also tends to withdraw from things.
