  BIO_H01: |-
    Sadayoshi transforms into military uniformed hero, with massive parallel weapons
    on his arms and legs.

    Through rigorous education and intense training, he has acquired much higher
    physical skills than the other soldiers, and through the parallel weapons in his
    hands and feet, he can unleash punches and kicks strengthened hundreds to
    thousands of times.

    Normally, he saves the release of his power according to the surrounding
    environment, but when he fires his fist at maximum power, an earthquake with
    violent earth cracks is said to occur all around him.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Sadayoshi has been raised to believe that his body should be used to protect the
    people, and he has become a hero to faithfully carry out that duty, to protect
    the people with all his body.

    Some people call him a toadie or a lapdog, but he cares little about the jeers
    of others.

    Of course, he has desires and emotions that he keeps hidden from the public.

    What he doesn't know is that when he unleashes the desires he has locked away,
    he will become a stronger and more resilient hero than ever before.
