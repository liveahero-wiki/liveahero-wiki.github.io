  BIO_H01: |-
    Sadayoshi transforms into military uniformed hero, with massive parallel weapons
    on his arms and legs.

    Through rigorous education and intense training, he has acquired much higher
    physical skills than the other soldiers, and through the parallel weapons in his
    hands and feet, he can unleash punches and kicks strengthened hundreds to
    thousands of times.

    Normally, he saves the release of his power according to the surrounding
    environment, but when he fires his fist at maximum power, an earthquake with
    violent earth cracks is said to occur all around him.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Sadayoshi has been raised to believe that his body should be used to protect the
    people, and he has become a hero to faithfully carry out that duty, to protect
    the people with all his body.

    Some people call him a toadie or a lapdog, but he cares little about the jeers
    of others.

    Of course, he has desires and emotions that he keeps hidden from the public.

    What he doesn't know is that when he unleashes the desires he has locked away,
    he will become a stronger and more resilient hero than ever before.

  BIO_H01: |-
    Surviving in an unhabited island, Sadayoshi has been able to break through his usual defenses and unleash his own emotions better than before.
  
    His new suit is similar to beach volleyball players.
  
    His sun visor-shaped parallel weapon can capture a target and determines the point of attack,
    then the ball-shaped parallel weapon becomes a high-density energy projectile that   always lands at that point.
  
    Sadayoshi, now lighter after shedding his huge glove-shaped parallel weapon, leaps freely with his body as high as he can go.
  BIO_H02: |-
    Pushing aside his selfishness, Sadayoshi eat and sleep together with the villains who follows their own beliefs, and come into contact with the true meaning of freedom.
  
    Although his firm belief that wrongdoing will not be tolerated remains unchanged,
    he begins to believe that learning about the other person is the first step toward changing his stiff self.
  
    And then, instead of walk a path other wants him to, he will choose his own path.
  
    With his own emotions overflowing from the depths of his heart, he jumps on the beach and stares at the ball, not caring about the sweat that pours out of him.
  
    That face showed his experience and confidence, decorated with a dazzling smile.
