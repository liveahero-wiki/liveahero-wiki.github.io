    Yasuhiko transform into a hero with flashy golden costume, he fights with his
    most accomplished performance skills, acrobatics with fierce animals.

    From his memory, he construct and summon the animals who used to accompany him
    when polishing his skill as energy bodies.

    There are four of them, the friendly lion Renat, the Calm elephant Rufina, the
    gentle tiger Bogdan, and the proud giraffe Dar'ya.

    With a signal from his whip, they move in unison against the enemy, which is
    just like an entertainment show and draws applause from the audience.

    Yasuhiko's dream is "to make Yatomi Circus troupe a famous circus troupe in the
    universe".

    Yasuhiko has mixed feelings about this circus troupe that his father had
    reestablished, as he and his father, the previous leader of the troupe, have
    separated with a deep rift.

    But now that he is in a position to lead the circus troupe that he had admired
    since he was a child, he cannot abandon his friends who trust and follow him,
    and he want to take them to great heights.

    Yasuhiko's passion for the circus and his strong sense of responsibility are the
    driving force that overcomes his negative feelings toward his father.

  BIO_S01: |-
    A young leader of a long-established circus troupe based in Orient City.

    His full name is Yatomi Yasuhiko.

    He left his Japanese father, who was busy running the circus, and lived in
    Moscow with his Russian mother.

    He has seen many circus performances from his early childhood, and with his
    father being a circus ringmaster as well, he has a deep knowledge of the circus,
    and at the same time was also quite involved in it.

    He is a young man who is cheerful, determined, and most of all loves to
    entertain, but his feud with his father and the dilemma of not being able to run
    the circus as he wishes cast a dark shadow on his mind.
