Yasuhiko's dream is "to make Yatomi Circus troupe a famous circus troupe in the universe".

Yasuhiko has mixed feelings about this circus troupe that his father had reestablished, as he and his father, the previous leader of the troupe, have separated with a deep rift.

But now that he is in a position to lead the circus troupe that he had admired since he was a child, he cannot abandon his friends who trust and follow him, and he want to take them to great heights.

Yasuhiko's passion for the circus and his strong sense of responsibility are the driving force that overcomes his negative feelings toward his father.

A young leader of a long-established circus troupe based in Orient City.

His full name is Yatomi Yasuhiko.

He left his Japanese father, who was busy running the circus, and lived in Moscow with his Russian mother.

He has seen many circus performances from his early childhood, and with his father being a circus ringmaster as well, he has a deep knowledge of the circus, and at the same time was also quite involved in it.

He is a young man who is cheerful, determined, and most of all loves to entertain, but his feud with his father and the dilemma of not being able to run the circus as he wishes cast a dark shadow on his mind.
