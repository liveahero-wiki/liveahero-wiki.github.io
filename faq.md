## How can I change the language in the game to English?

This game was only available in Japanese language until the 22/01/2026. The game is now partially translated in English, Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese, and you'll be able to locate the language setting in "Option".

The translations up to now are involving :

- Main title screen
- Home menu and its directories (Options, sales, assistant management, profile,...), training, formation, ether shearch and banner (gacha), shop. Some sub-sections has only been partially translated (such as Office)
- Quest menu and its differents sections, like Training/growth quests or Boss simulator
- Most characters informations (names, powers names and descriptions, contract memories, personnal informations,...), Home menu voicelines, event lobby voicelines
- (Past) Event lobby main hub, event description from the past events list and challenge / reward section (Only partially ; Event storyline aren't translated yet)
- Chapter 1 of the main campaign

## How can I play?

Look at [Getting Started](/guide/) guide for the basic stuffs. There are more gameplay guides under "Basic Information" section in
the wiki's navigation sidebar.

For story translation, Roureem has been doing fan translation summaries at [https://housamosummaries.blogspot.com/](https://housamosummaries.blogspot.com/).
Please wait patiently for new translation as he has been translating this game and Tokyo Afterschool Summoner together.

## Where is Wood Wolfman (and other obtainable mob)'s information on Wiki？

Obtainable mobs are listed in [Heroes/Sidekicks](/charas/) like other characters.

For non-obtainable version of mobs, see [here](/mobs/).

## Where can I find voice audio files on Wiki？

Due to LifeWonders' copyright guidelines, "it is prohibited to rip data such as music or character voice lines from the game through methods such as datamining and recording.",
so we can't publish them here. ~~Plus this Wiki only has 1GB space.~~

The voice line translations are available in their respective character pages.

## Is this Wiki affiliated with LifeWonders？

No, but we know that LifeWonders employee(s) are aware of our work.
